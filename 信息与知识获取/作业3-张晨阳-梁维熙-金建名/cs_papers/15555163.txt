Description:
An interactive collaborative robotic system to play Italian checkers is presented in this paper. The system detects the state of the game using a camera, calculates the optimal move using a developed decision-making algorithm, and executes pick-and-place tasks to physically move the pieces on the board. The developed system is implemented in a real-world setup using a Franka Emika arm as pieces manipulator. The experimental results show the feasibility of proposed approach.

This study was carried out within the Interconnected Nord-Est Innovation Ecosystem (iNEST) and received funding from the European Union Next-GenerationEU (PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) &ndash; MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.5 &ndash; D.D. 1058 23/06/2022, ECS00000043).
