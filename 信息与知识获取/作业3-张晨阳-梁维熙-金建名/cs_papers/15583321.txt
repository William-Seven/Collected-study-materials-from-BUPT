Description:
The rural revitalization strategy, guided by China&rsquo;s vision for national rejuvenation, emphasizes activating endogenous development in rural areas. Yet in practice, many grassroots initiatives suffer from &ldquo;floating public projects,&rdquo; where government dominates while local participation lags. This paper examines how administrative decentralization can effectively stimulate rural endogenous power by analyzing the transformation of R Village&mdash;a once-declining bonsai-producing village plagued by governance issues and economic stagnation. Through the downward extension of administrative authority, public resources, and governance concepts, R Village achieved organizational restructuring, industrial revitalization, and community re-engagement. The case demonstrates the potential of a &ldquo;new endogenous development&rdquo; model that integrates external support with internal capacity-building. R Village&rsquo;s shift from a &ldquo;weak and dispersed&rdquo; village to a national model offers valuable insights for sustainable rural development and broader rural revitalization efforts.
