Description:
<em><span>Libraries play a pivotal role in democratizing knowledge and fostering social empowerment. In the context of women&rsquo;s empowerment, libraries act as agents of change by facilitating access to information, promoting literacy, and providing safe spaces for learning and dialogue. This paper explores the connection between libraries and women&rsquo;s empowerment through the lens of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar&rsquo;s ideas of gender equality. Ambedkar, a visionary social reformer and architect of the Indian Constitution, emphasized education and equal rights for women as essential to social justice. His advocacy for women's liberation from caste and patriarchal structures finds contemporary relevance in how libraries serve as tools for transformation. This paper examines historical milestones, current practices, and future strategies to align library initiatives with Ambedkar&rsquo;s egalitarian principles. Through case studies, policy reviews, and community-based experiences, the paper argues that libraries are not just repositories of books but instruments of equity, especially for marginalized women. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted, covering gender studies, library science, and legal frameworks to propose an inclusive model of library services that promotes women&rsquo;s autonomy, leadership, and participation in nation-building.</span></em>
