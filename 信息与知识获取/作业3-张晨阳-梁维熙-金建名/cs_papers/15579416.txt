Description:
<span lang="EN-US">Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s Lucky Starr series, published under the pseudonym Paul French between 1952 and 1958, serves as a unique fusion of adventure fiction and scientifically grounded storytelling. Aimed at a younger audience, these six novels provide not only entertainment but also scientific knowledge and ethical reflection, positioning the series as a formative example of educational science fiction for children. This article explores how the Lucky Starr series employs pedagogical strategies, embeds factual scientific content, and models intellectual problem-solving to engage young readers. Through a close reading of the series and comparison with broader educational science fiction traditions, the study reveals how Asimov balances narrative appeal with instructional value, laying groundwork for science literacy and critical thinking.</span>
