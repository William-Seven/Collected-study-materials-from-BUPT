Description:
An integral part of contemporary initiatives striving to promote and create self-sustainable communities has&nbsp;been the integration and efficient management of renewable energy sources, energy storage solutions, and&nbsp;sustainable heating and cooling assets. This paper presents a unique combination of diverse technologies,&nbsp;ranging from established data management solutions like SQL and NoSQL databases to custom semantic&nbsp;solutions and device-specific control adapters powered by the OpenMUC gateway. Additionally, it incorporates&nbsp;analytical machine learning-based forecasting solutions paired with optimization algorithms, working together&nbsp;to enable energy self-sufficiency. The platform constituted by these solutions is subsequently utilized to provide&nbsp;predictive and real-time control of energy assets in various facilities in line with the selected operation strategy.&nbsp;Its application, particularly in terms of effective energy storage utilization and timing of asset activation&nbsp;scheduling, ultimately results in improvements in renewable energy integration and overall increase of energy&nbsp;efficiency in the considered buildings. As demonstrated in real-world use cases tested within prosumer-based&nbsp;energy communities in geographical islands, the application of the platform resulted in tangible modifications&nbsp;to the primary statistical characteristics of electrical energy consumption clearly signified, among others, by a&nbsp;reduction in mean consumption of between 40 W and 190 W. Through scrutinizing the achieved results, it can&nbsp;be concluded that the platform displays the capabilities to outperform stock control algorithms provided by&nbsp;the inverter vendors. Expanding upon the application limited to the electric assets, use cases in the thermal&nbsp;domain where optimization outputs are utilized for heat pump scheduling were also discussed and presented.
