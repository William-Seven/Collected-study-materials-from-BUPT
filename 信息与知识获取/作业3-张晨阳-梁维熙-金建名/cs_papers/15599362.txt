<em><span lang="EN-US">As the world becomes more interconnected through digital platforms, ensuring cybersecurity across borders has become a complex challenge. One often overlooked but crucial factor in global cybersecurity is accurate translation. The effectiveness of cybersecurity measures, from legal compliance to user awareness and cross-border cooperation, heavily relies on the precision and clarity of translated materials. Inaccurate translations of cybersecurity regulations, training documents, and threat intelligence can result in legal risks, security breaches, and delayed responses to cyberattacks. This article examines the significant role of translation in ensuring digital safety, with a focus on how translation errors can expose vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape. The study analyzes various contexts where translation is critical, including the interpretation of international cybersecurity laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the communication of security best practices in multilingual training materials, and the collaboration between law enforcement agencies in cross-border cybercrime investigations. Furthermore, the article addresses the limitations of machine translation tools in handling highly technical and specialized cybersecurity content, highlighting the need for human expertise in this domain. The importance of cultural sensitivity in translation is also discussed, as different regions have diverse legal frameworks and cultural attitudes toward privacy and security. The analysis concludes that accurate, culturally aware translation is essential to maintaining global cybersecurity. A hybrid translation model that combines the speed of machine translation with human oversight is recommended for ensuring the reliability and clarity of cybersecurity communications. As digital threats continue to evolve, the role of translation in safeguarding information and systems will remain a vital component of international cybersecurity efforts, protecting sensitive data and facilitating secure online interactions across linguistic and cultural boundaries.</span></em>
