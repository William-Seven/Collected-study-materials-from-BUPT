Description:
<span lang="EN-US">at the C1 level, language learners possess advanced linguistic skills but often need to move beyond rote memorization to achieve true communicative competence. This article explores how critical thinking enhances advanced language learning by fostering deeper comprehension, nuanced expression, and cultural adaptability among C1-level students. Using a mixed-methods study with 40 C1-level EFL learners, we investigated the impact of critical thinking activities (e.g., debates, problem-solving tasks) on linguistic accuracy, discourse competence, and learner autonomy. Results showed significant improvements in analytical writing (18.5%), oral argumentation (20.2%), and self-directed learning behaviors. Qualitative data revealed heightened engagement and confidence. This article synthesizes research on critical thinking and language acquisition, offering practical strategies for teachers to integrate these skills into advanced language classrooms.</span>
