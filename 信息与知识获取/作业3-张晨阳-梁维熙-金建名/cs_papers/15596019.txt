Description:
<span lang="EN-US">The article explores the integration of speech competence and digital technologies in teaching English as a foreign language. The focus is on the competency-based approach, which aims at the formation and development of foreign language communicative competence (FLCC), comprising linguistic, speech, and sociocultural components. Special attention is given to the development of speech competence, particularly listening and speaking skills, which are key to successful communication. An analysis of modern electronic resources shows that the use of digital tools in distance learning effectively supports the development of these skills. At the same time, objective difficulties in listening and individual learner characteristics are highlighted, which must be taken into account when designing teaching methodologies. In conclusion, it is stated that a well-designed methodology incorporating digital technologies can significantly enhance students&rsquo; speech training and strengthen their overall foreign language communicative competence.</span>
