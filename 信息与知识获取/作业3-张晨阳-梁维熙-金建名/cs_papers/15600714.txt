This study explores the relationship between the level of parental involvement and the academic performance of primary school students in J District, Q City, Heilongjiang Province, China. Adopting a quantitative research approach, data were collected by distributing structured questionnaires to a representative sample of students selected through stratified sampling. This study delves deeply into the key aspects of parental involvement, including emotional involvement, intellectual involvement, and behavioral involvement, and examines the correlations between these aspects and students&rsquo; academic achievements. Various statistical methods that include as correlation analysis were employed to evaluate the strength and significance of these relationships. The research findings indicate that there is a significant positive correlation between the level of parental involvement and students&rsquo; academic performance, suggesting that a higher degree of parental involvement is a powerful predictor of students achieving better educational outcomes. These results imply that promoting greater parental involvement and providing relevant guidance can enhance students&rsquo; learning effectiveness.
