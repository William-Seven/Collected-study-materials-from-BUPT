Description:
<em><span lang="EN-US">The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) that offer seamless interaction between users and their environments. This report presents the design and implementation of a real-time voice assistant, capable of understanding and processing natural language commands while providing contextual information about the surrounding environment. The system is designed to address various user needs, including accessibility for visually impaired individuals, hands-free operation in specialized work settings, and enhanced interactivity in smart environments. The IVA integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques to recognize user commands and provide accurate responses. Advanced NLP models such as BERT and GPT are used to understand user intent, while adaptive learning mechanisms ensure the assistant continuously improves based on user interactions. The system also supports multimodal interactions, combining voice commands with visual and environmental data to enhance user experience. The architecture includes a message broker for real-time communication between voice recognition, object detection, and response generation modules, ensuring quick and reliable information processing. Performance metrics show that the system achieves an intent recognition accuracy of over 90%, with a response time of less than 2 seconds. This demonstrates significant improvement over existing virtual assistants, particularly in adaptability and user personalization. The report discusses the methodology, system architecture, and technologies used in the project, including speech recognition frameworks like Google&rsquo;s Speech-to-Text and machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow. The project has successfully addressed limitations in current systems by incorporating a learning engine and scalable architecture, making it a promising solution for future applications in accessibility and smart environments.</span></em>
