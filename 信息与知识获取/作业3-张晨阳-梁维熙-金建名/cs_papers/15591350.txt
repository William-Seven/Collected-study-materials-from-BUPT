Description:
<span>The primary objective of the current research was to explore the efficacy of Cognitive Restructuring (CR) in treating insomnia and fatigue among university students with somatic symptom complaints. It was hypothesized that there would be a notable distinction in the score of insomnia, fatigue, and somatic symptoms between the pre-test and post-test scores after receiving Cognitive Restructuring. The sample of the study (n=313) was collected through Simple Random Sampling from a public sector university of Peshawar, KPK. The age range of the participants was between 18-30 years (M=1.52, SD=5.31). Among 313 participants, n=21 received Cognitive Restructuring. A 6-week therapeutic program was implemented. The Somatic Symptom Scale-8, Regensburg&rsquo;s Insomnia Scale, and Fatigue Assessment Scale were used for somatic symptom complaints, insomnia, and fatigue, respectively. The Pearson Product-Moment Correlation, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, and Simple Linear Regression were used for statistical analyses. The results showed that Cognitive Restructuring promisingly reduced insomnia, fatigue, and somatic symptoms. While on Simple Linear Regression, somatic symptoms were the strongest predictor of fatigue and insomnia (p&lt;.001).</span>
