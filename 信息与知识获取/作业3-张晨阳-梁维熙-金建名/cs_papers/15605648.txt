<span lang="EN-PH">This study investigated students' proficiency levels in the K-12 Education Program within a small division during the 2023-2024 academic year. It examined student demographics and proficiency in English across reading, writing, speaking, and listening domains. Findings revealed that many students with older age, fewer siblings, and lower-income backgrounds exhibit proficiency levels below planning standards across all assessed areas. The study underscored the need for targeted interventions tailored to the linguistic needs of students within identified demographic profiles. Specifically, most respondents were seniors with fewer siblings and belonged to lower-income families. Despite comparable proficiency levels across demographic groups, a statistically significant difference in writing proficiency based on age was observed. Recommendations included implementing targeted intervention programs, developing structured curricula, introducing interactive exercises, and fostering a supportive learning environment to enhance English proficiency. Additionally, further investigation into factors influencing writing proficiency and the continuous adaptation of teaching methods was advised to promote academic success in English education.</span>
