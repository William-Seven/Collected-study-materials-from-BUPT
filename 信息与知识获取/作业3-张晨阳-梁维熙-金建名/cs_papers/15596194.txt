Description:
<h2>Abstract:</h2>
&nbsp;Introduction: Currently, sports practice at an early age is being undermined by the lack of interest among young people in physical activity. Furthermore, the use of bikes for recreational purposes or as means of transport is also declining due to the emergence of other more convenient means of transport such as electric scooters. Aim: This proposal aims to provide additional resources to teachers when implementing cycling-oriented learning situations. The purpose is to increase interest and adherence to physical activity by combining motor games and cycling, from a recreational perspective, trying to make each proposed activity as attractive as possible and to ensure that the students have a great deal of fun. Methods: It presents a practical proposal of 11 motor games adapted to be played with the bicycle in Physical Education sessions. This small battery of games can also be useful for instructors of cycling sports schools, even at younger ages, due to the greater technical ability of the pupils. Conclusions: The use of bicycles is regulated in the Secondary Education curriculum, both as a sport and as a recreational and means of transport. Therefore, this proposal can be a good starting point for those teachers who consider that they do not have the necessary knowledge to work on cycling-related content.
