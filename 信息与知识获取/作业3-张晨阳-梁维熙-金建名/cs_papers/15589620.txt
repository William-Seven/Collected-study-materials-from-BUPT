Description:
<em><span>The 2018 General Education Curriculum of Vietnam places strong emphasis on developing students' qualities and competencies. This development must be grounded in the application of innovative teaching methods and techniques that foster creative thinking and enhance students' learning outcomes. Competency development plays a crucial role in providing students with a solid foundation of knowledge, thereby promoting creative thinking and forming effective learning habits.</span></em>

<em><span>This article explores the approach of developing musical competence through multiple pathways by integrating music with other academic subjects. Such interdisciplinary integration helps students achieve a balanced psychological and emotional state, supports scientific and goal-oriented learning, and creates a dynamic and engaging classroom environment.</span></em>

<em><span>At the 4th-grade level, students are naturally curious and eager to explore. Therefore, integrating music with other subjects enables them to develop a holistic perspective on the topics they study. The development of musical competence through interdisciplinary connections with selected subjects aims to fulfill the objectives and expected outcomes outlined in Vietnam's 2018 General Education Curriculum.</span></em>
