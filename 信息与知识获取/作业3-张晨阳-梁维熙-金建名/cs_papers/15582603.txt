Description:
The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has established comprehensive quality indicators to evaluate and enhance the performance of Indian higher education institutions since 1994. This research presents a comparative analysis of best practices and challenges in implementing NAAC's quality indicators across diverse institutional contexts in India. Through a mixed-methods approach involving quantitative analysis of 200 institutions and qualitative examination of 15 case studies, this study evaluates the effectiveness, applicability, and impact of NAAC's seven core quality criteria: curricular aspects, teaching-learning and evaluation, research innovations and extension, infrastructure and learning resources, student support and progression, governance and leadership, and institutional values and best practices. The findings reveal significant variations in implementation success across institutional types, with private universities and central universities demonstrating superior performance in research and infrastructure indicators, while state universities and colleges face challenges in resource allocation and faculty development. The study identifies ten exemplary best practices including integrated curriculum design, innovative pedagogical approaches, robust research ecosystems, and comprehensive student support systems. Key challenges include resource constraints, faculty shortages, assessment standardization, and sustainability of quality improvements. The research concludes that while NAAC's quality indicators provide a comprehensive framework for institutional evaluation, their effective implementation requires differentiated approaches, sustained resource commitment, and continuous stakeholder engagement. The findings offer valuable insights for institutional leaders, policymakers, and quality assurance agencies seeking to enhance higher education quality in India and similar emerging economy contexts.
