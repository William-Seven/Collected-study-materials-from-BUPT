Description:
This concept paper presents a modular system for intelligent voice interaction, based on existing technologies and primarily aimed at practical integration. The goal is to develop an everyday, expandable assistance system that enables continuous, context-related communication by combining AI-driven analysis with a standardized voice interface. The proposal differs from existing smart home or voice assistant solutions through a deliberately open architecture that can integrate smart avatars (e.g., service robots) in addition to mobile components. Furthermore, the system allows for a structured analysis of human interaction with learning systems&mdash;particularly for evaluating reliability, adaptability, and semantic understanding. This concept is therefore aimed at both practice-oriented developers and research teams in human-machine interaction. Initial test scenarios are planned in a private environment; a gradual expansion is planned on a modular basis.

Initial proof of feasibility will be presented as subsequent versions of the concept paper.
