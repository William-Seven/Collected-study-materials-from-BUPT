Description:
The study investigated teachers&rsquo; perception of continuous professional development (CPD) implementation and the mediating role of teachers&rsquo; professional knowledge in improving teaching and learning in Ghana. A survey was conducted, and valid questionnaires were retrieved from 329 teachers using the KoboCollect Tool, a self-reporting online structured questionnaire for data collection in selected public schools across Ghana. The sample comprised teachers who participated for at least two years in CPD programmes in Ghana and have been in professional practice. Descriptive statistics were used in the data analysis. Many teachers acknowledged the positive influence of CPD on practice and professional growth, there were significant concerns about the quality, sufficiency, and clarity of vision in the programmes. The results showed that the CPD programmes as practiced showed a leaning towards a one-size-fits-all CPD model which does not adapt to differences in subject areas, levels of expertise, and grade levels, thus lacking flexibility in training. It is recommended that policy makers such as Ministry of Education (MOE), Ghana Education Service (GES), National Teaching Council (NTC) and service providers should prioritize aligning CPD programmes with teachers' specific needs and include contents that address the different skill sets and subject areas required by teachers across different educational levels.
