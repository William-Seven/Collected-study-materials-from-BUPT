Description:
<span lang="EN-US">Primary school students predominantly engage in thinking through imagination. The rules and phenomena of their native language require abstract thinking, which is often challenging for children at this age. As a result, they are naturally inclined toward play and physical activity. According to the current curriculum, game-based activities are frequently integrated into lessons. This is because acquiring knowledge through games is generally perceived by students as more engaging than memorizing dry rules or repetitive exercises. Games help reinforce the subject matter more effectively and ensure better retention.</span>
