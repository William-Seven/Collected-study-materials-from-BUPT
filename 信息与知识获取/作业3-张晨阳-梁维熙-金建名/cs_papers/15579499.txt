Description:
ONTraC (Ordered Niche Trajectory Construction) is a niche-centered, machine learning method for constructing spatially continuous trajectories. ONTraC differs from existing tools in that it treats a niche, rather than an individual cell, as the basic unit for spatial trajectory analysis. In this context, we define niche as a multicellular, spatially localized region where different cell types may coexist and interact with each other. ONTraC seamlessly integrates cell-type composition and spatial information by using the graph neural network modeling framework. Its output, which is called the niche trajectory, can be viewed as a one dimensional representation of the tissue microenvironment continuum. By disentangling cell-level and niche- level properties, niche trajectory analysis provides a coherent framework to study coordinated responses from all the cells in association with continuous tissue microenvironment variations.
