Description:
<h3><strong>1. Today (2024-06-27), we discovered an issue with the labeling of sample groups in one of the supplementary figures (Supplementary Figure 14c) in our published article. We have corrected the figure and present it here, and we extend our apologies to all readers for any confusion this may have caused (although no report received).</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>2. The source data of supplementary figure 13 in the accompanying article table has been found to have issues, which were identified as a result of improper Excel operation. Here, we have uploaded the correct data table</strong></h3>
--------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

1.&nbsp;ecDNA_cargo_gene_modeling_data.csv.gz

The dataset contains features from 386 TCGA tumors for modeling ecDNA cargo gene prediction. It was converted from R data format with the following&nbsp;code. NOTE: columns 'sample' and 'gene_id' are not used for actual modeling but for identifying, and sampling purposes.

library(data.table)

data = readRDS("~/../Downloads/ecDNA_cargo_gene_modeling_data.rds")

colnames(data)[3] = "total_cn"

data.table::fwrite(data, file = "~/../Downloads/ecDNA_cargo_gene_modeling_data.csv.gz", sep = ",")

&nbsp;

2.&nbsp;gcap_pcawg_WGS_result.tar.gz

GCAP analysis results for PCAWG allele-specific copy number profiles derived from WGS.

&nbsp;

3.&nbsp;gcap_tcga_snp6_result.tar.gz

GCAP analysis results for TCGA allele-specific copy number profiles derived from SNP6 array.

&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;gcap_Changkang_WES_result.tar.gz

GCAP analysis results for SYSUCC Changkang&nbsp;allele-specific copy number profiles derived from tumor-normal paired WES.

&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;tcga_overlap_gene_wgs.rds,&nbsp;tcga_overlap_gene_snp.rds and&nbsp;tcga_overlap_gene_wes.rds

These datasets contain TCGA gene-level copy number results in R data format from overlapping samples (dataset above). WGS from PCAWG, SNP array, and WES from GDC portal.
