Description:
<span lang="EN-US">This study examined the student engagement and learning outcomes in mathematics through Localized Learning Approach (LLA) in two Grade 8 classes at Dagatkidavao Integrated School. LLA focuses on practical applications, incorporates the mother tongue, and utilizes community resources. The structured process involves three steps: pre-assessment, formal instruction, and post-assessment. This study employed a quasi-experimental research design. Engagement was assessed using the Mathematics Student-Report Engagement Scales, while learning outcomes were measured through a 30-item, content-validated multiple-choice test. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted to identify the elements and impacts of LLA on engagement and outcomes. Results indicated that students using LLA showed improvement on their level of engagement and learning outcomes and the NLLA group also showed progress but gained less. ANCOVA results revealed a statistically significant results in engagement for the LLA group. Similarly, the LLA group showed significant results in learning outcomes</span>
