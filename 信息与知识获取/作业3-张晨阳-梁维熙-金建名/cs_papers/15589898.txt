Description:
This study explores the challenges faced by non-special education teachers in instructing students with special needs in inclusive classrooms, a critical issue amidst the global shift toward inclusive education. General education teachers often encounter significant barriers such as insufficient training, resource limitations, difficulties in adapting curricula, and the complexities of managing diverse classrooms. These challenges not only impact their effectiveness but also contribute to heightened stress and diminished job satisfaction. Focusing on the experiences of eight non-special education teachers from Warraphat School in Thailand, specifically within kindergartens 1 to 3, this research employs a qualitative phenomenological approach to uncover key themes and actionable insights that can enhance teacher preparedness and the inclusivity of educational environments. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews, allowing participants to share their lived experiences, professional struggles, and adaptive strategies. Thematic reflections revealed several critical issues, including the need for flexible instructional methods, the significance of fostering social interactions among students, and the barriers posed by resource shortages and cultural or language differences. These findings underscore the importance of creating adaptive and supportive learning environments and highlight the value of professional collaboration and ongoing development for educators. Based on these insights, the study proposes the "Empowering Inclusive Classrooms" action plan, a comprehensive framework designed to address the challenges identified. This plan emphasizes individualized instructional approaches, enhanced communication strategies, targeted professional development, and initiatives to foster peer support and social inclusion. The research findings contribute valuable knowledge for learners, teachers, administrators, policymakers, and researchers by illuminating the systemic barriers and opportunities for improvement in inclusive education. The study concludes with actionable recommendations, such as implementing professional development programs, fostering collaborative classroom cultures, and adopting inclusive educational practices that celebrate diversity. Ultimately, this research seeks to empower educators and enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of classrooms for all students, particularly those with special needs.
