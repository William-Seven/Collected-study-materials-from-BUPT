Description:
Gender bias continues to affect the academic and clinical experiences of nursing students within atraditionally female-dominated profession. Both male and female students face discriminatory attitudes,role stereotyping, and unequal opportunities, which influence their learning, self-confidence, andprofessional identity. This qualitative literature review examines the experiences of nursing students withgender bias and its impact on their educational journey. Eighteen qualitative studies published between2010 and 2024 were analyzed using thematic analysis. Relevant literature was sourced from databasesincluding PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Five key themes emerged: role stereotyping,unequal clinical placement opportunities, peer exclusion, reduced confidence and identity challenges, andcoping strategies. Male students reported marginalization and questioning of their professional choice,while female students noted subtle biases in leadership roles and academic evaluation. The findingshighlight the need for targeted interventions to create a more equitable learning environment.Recommendations include integrating gender-sensitivity training into nursing curricula, increasing facultyawareness, and ensuring equal clinical exposure. Institutions must also encourage peer support and opendiscussion around gender roles in nursing. Further research is needed to explore how other factors, suchas socio-economic status and ethnicity, intersect with gender bias to shape student experiences.&nbsp;
