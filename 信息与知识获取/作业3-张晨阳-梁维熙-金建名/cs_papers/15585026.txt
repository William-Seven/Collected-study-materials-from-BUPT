Description:
Being a cornerstone of Industry 4.0, Asset Administration Shell (AAS) enables seamless integration and interaction among the physical and digital worlds. There are multiple different tools and technologies available for implementing AAS. The purpose of this study is to support the tool and technology selection decision of AAS modelers and implementers. For that purpose, we conducted a literature survey and identified four active tools, and in the study, we included all of them: AASX server, Eclipse BaSyx, FA<sup>3</sup>ST service, and NOVAAS. Using a comprehensive criteria list, we conducted a thorough comparison of the selected technologies. The comparison was made in two steps: first for initial learning exercises and second for a real case study where digital twins belong to real assets in a facility belonging to the petrochemical industry. Among the evaluated tools, Eclipse BaSyx demonstrated superior performance compared to the other three tools investigated in this study. Future research will focus on incorporating machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models associated with the assets, leveraging datasets generated by the sensors installed on the system.
