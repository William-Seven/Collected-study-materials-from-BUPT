Description:
Knowledge of academic-scientific vocabulary in any field of study differentiates well-prepared universitystudents from those with academic deficiencies. When analyzing the various elements that contribute toadequate scientific training of future chemistry professionals, it seems undoubted that the acquisition andcorrect use of basic academic-scientific language represents a transcendental factor in their professionalsuccess. The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the impact of learning specialized academic vocabularyin the students that attend a spectroscopic class, that is, vocabulary that belongs to a specific area or fieldof knowledge, on spectroscopic techniquesIt important to note that the aim and the scope of thiscontribution it doesn't consider the emotional or cognitive aspects of learning of specialized academicscientific vocabulary. In this sense a methodological proposal is presented to evaluate in a practical,efficient and reliable way the acquisition of specialized academic-scientific vocabulary in a group ofuniversity students. With the results generated, it is proposed that certain activities be carried out throughcollaborative work by the students, to facilitate the learning and understanding of the academic scientificterms associated with the techniques of UV-Vis, IR, MS and NMR. Likewise, it is proposed to implementspecific activities that reinforce the vocabulary of the UV-Vis technique. The findings of the study revealednot show a significant statistical difference regarding the management of scientific vocabulary betweenboth genders
