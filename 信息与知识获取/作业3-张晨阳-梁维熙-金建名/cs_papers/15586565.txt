Description:
This presentation explores the physical behavior and structural transformations of water molecules under extreme space conditions using molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations. The study investigates the effects of ultralow temperatures, high pressures, vacuum, electromagnetic radiation, plasma, and confinement in nanostructures on water&rsquo;s molecular properties.

Key case studies include simulations of water in nanopores, one-dimensional water chains in graphene nanotubes and bilayers, and clusters of nanodiamonds capturing water molecules. The presentation discusses implications for astrophysics, astrobiology, and materials science, highlighting the relevance of water&rsquo;s behavior to space missions and the origin of life theories.
