Description:
Although he does not quote Richelet in the preface to his edition of the Dictionnaireuniversel and attributes exclusively to the Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise the role of guide andguarantee of his lexicographical choices, Basnage refers to Richelet even more thanto the Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise. Basnage not only transcribes entries or senses, syntactic constructions and authorial quotations from the Dictionnaire fran&ccedil;ois (1693), butalso takes up its didactic and descriptive intentions. As both lexicographers are&nbsp;familiar, for different reasons, with the doubts of those learning a foreign language,they make similar lexicographical choices. The didactic intentions can be seen inthe spelling chosen as well as in the author citations and grammatical elementsprovided in their dictionaries. Descriptive intentions are evident in the fact that&nbsp;Richelet and Basnage record all the linguistic usages of which they are aware and atmost suggest their preference by relying on the authority of writers and linguistswho have used or spoken in favour of a specific usage. The aim of this article isto assess the extent to which Basnage drew inspiration from Richelet by analysing the common features of the two lexicographers&rsquo; dictionaries, while seeking tounderstand the reasons why Basnage neglected to refer to Richelet.
