<span lang="EN-PH">This study explores the strategic role of mentoring in cultivating future educational leaders within school settings. Drawing from Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) and the concept of communities of practice, the research highlights how structured mentorship promotes professional growth, fosters leadership identity, and enhances organizational resilience. Through an analysis of relevant literature and best practices, the study underscores the impact of intentional mentoring on both individual and institutional development. It also examines the significance of distributed leadership and boundary crossing (Akkerman &amp; Bakker, 2011) in fostering collaborative environments where mentees engage in both teaching and leadership roles. Emphasis is placed on how mentorship, when aligned with supportive policies and embedded in school culture, can lead to sustainable leadership pipelines. The findings advocate for institutionalizing mentorship through policies that allocate time, training, and resources to ensure its effectiveness. Ultimately, the study argues that school leaders who mentor emerging educators leave behind a legacy of innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, thereby reinforcing the school's capacity to thrive in complex educational landscapes.</span>
