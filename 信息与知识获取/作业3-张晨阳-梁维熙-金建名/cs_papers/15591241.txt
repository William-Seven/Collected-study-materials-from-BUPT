Description:
<b>About this machine-actionable data management plan (maDMP)</b><div>The open maDMP will serve as the reference framework for all data-related activities&#8212;collection, processing, generation, and storage&#8212;within the Horizon Europe EU-CHINA BRIDGE project (Grant Agreement No. 101137971). Hosted in ARGOS, the maDMP outlines every dataset to be created, managed, and curated over the course of the project. These datasets will be deposited in the project&#8217;s Zenodo community (https://zenodo.org/communities/eu-china-bridge/) and directly linked within the ARGOS maDMP.</div><div><span>In addition, a dedicated report (D7.6) will be released in September 2024, providing general guidance for all project datasets. This includes an overview of the expected data, principles for FAIR data handling, data security practices, necessary resources, and ethical considerations. The report will be revised annually and will act as a practical guide for consortium partners, supporting them in managing their datasets and ensuring that the maDMP in ARGOS is kept up to date with proper descriptions and metadata.</span></div><div></div><div><b>About the project&#10;</b></div><div>EU-CHINA BRIDGE will support the transition to a climate-neutral and resilient society in both Europe and&#10;</div><div>China by jointly advancing knowledge on technology innovations and roadmaps for decarbonising energy&#10;</div><div>intensive industries, co-creating innovative modelling by combining cutting-edge bottom-up and integrated&#10;</div><div>assessment modelling to quantify net-zero sustainable pathways, and developing the most updated and&#10;</div><div>comprehensive emissions data. It will intensively engage relevant stakeholders from both regions, enhancing&#10;</div><div>dialogues, and fostering mutual learning among policymakers, industries, and experts. It will deliver two open-&#10;</div><div>source EU-China joint technology inventories of promising net-zero emission technology options for the iron &amp;&#10;</div><div>steel and chemical industries, two co-implemented demonstrations of promising technologies in China, and&#10;</div><div>co-created scale-up paths and roadmaps of the selected industrial technologies in both regions. It will also&#10;</div><div>develop the most up-to-date, high-resolution, multi-sectoral, national and regional GHG and short-lived&#10;</div><div>climate pollutant emission inventories as well as dynamic monitoring of key emission sources at high&#10;</div><div>spatiotemporal granularity. A state-of-the-art modelling framework will be developed, exploiting and&#10;</div><div>advancing cutting-edge and established modelling tools for EU and China, using the latest emissions data,&#10;</div><div>representing technology and policy options, enabling assessment of socioeconomic impacts, covering multiple&#10;</div><div>economic sectors and regions, and offering high spatial and technology detail. The enhanced models will be&#10;</div><div>used to co-produce net-zero pathways for the EU and China, explicitly assessing co-benefits and trade-offs of&#10;</div><div>climate policies with other societal goals while exploring cooperation policies and governance to drive the&#10;</div><div>global transformation and assessing the distributional and global-level implications of the two regions&#8217;&#10;</div><div>decarbonisation. The pathways will be documented in new workspaces in the I2AM PARIS platform.</div><div></div><div><b>Funded by the European Union&#10;</b></div><div></div><div>&#10;</div><div>&#10;</div><div>&#10;</div><div>&#10;</div>
