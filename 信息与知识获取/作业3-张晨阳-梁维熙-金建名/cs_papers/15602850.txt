Description:
The WAND (Working-memory Adaptive-fatigue with N-back Difficulty) model is a software package for cognitive fatigue research. It provides a standardised protocol, implemented wth PsychoPy library in Python, to calibrate baseline performance, reduce learning effects, induce active mental fatigue, and measure its effects on working memory using sensitivity measures (d'; A'). The protocol uses an adaptive model across Spatial, and Dual N-back tasks and a stable Sequential task (to perserve statisical integrity across blocks) to maintain high cognitive load tailored to individual participant ability.
