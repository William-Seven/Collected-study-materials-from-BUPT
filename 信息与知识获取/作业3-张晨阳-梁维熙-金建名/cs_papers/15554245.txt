Description:
The study utilized a researcher-made questionnaire to gather data on the respondents' level of awareness and extent of practice of the Franciscan College of the Immaculate Conception (FCIC) core values. It also aimed to determine the significant relationship between awareness and practice, the significant differences in how these values are practiced, and the proposed output of the study. A quantitative research design was employed to assess the extent to which FCIC Junior High School students practice the core values. The study included 85 respondents, and statistical tools such as weighted mean and Chi-square tests were used to analyze the data. The survey findings indicate that all five key values&mdash;compassion, excellence, integrity, peace, and responsible stewardship&mdash;were well recognized by the respondents. However, in terms of application, students reported that they only fairly practiced these values. This suggests that while awareness of the core values is high, their consistent application in daily life remains an area for improvement. Further analysis revealed a direct relationship between awareness and practice, meaning that higher awareness of these values correlates with greater adherence to them in practice. The respondents demonstrated a moderate level of understanding and application of the core values, indicating room for further reinforcement. These findings emphasize that while students are generally aware of the FCIC core values and apply them to some extent, additional efforts are needed to enhance their practice. Strengthening the integration of these values in both academic and extracurricular activities could foster deeper internalization, thereby contributing to students' personal growth, ethical decision-making, and overall academic development.
