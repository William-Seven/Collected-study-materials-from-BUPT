Description:
<h1>ArCH - (Ar)tifact Filtering (C)lonal (H)ematapoiesis Variant Calling Pipeline</h1>
ArCH is a somatic variant calling pipeline designed to detect low variant allele fraction (VAF) clonal hematopoiesjsonsis (CH) variants. Starting from either unaligned FASTQ/BAM/CRAM files or aligned BAM/CRAM files, ArCH utilizes four variant callers (Mutect2, VarDictJava, LoFreq2, and Pindel) to detect somatic variants. These variants are then filtered using a variety of false positive filters and detection methods (false positive filters, panel of normal, etc.). The pipeline also generates VEP style annotations for all called variants as well as additional putative driver annotations generated from various database sources (TOPMed, MSK-IMPACT, COSMIC, OncoKB, etc.).

If you end up using this tool in your publication, please cite this paper:

<h2>Installation</h2>
This pipeline requires several files to be downloaded and configured prior to running. The following files are required for the pipeline to run:

<ol>
Reference Genome
Gene Panel Interval List
Panel of Normals
gnomAD VCF
VEP Cache &amp; Plugins
Somalier VCF
COSMIC VCF
</ol>
Step-by-step instructions to prepare each file will be provided below.

<h3>Panel of Normals</h3>
One of the most important pieces of this pipeline is the Panel of Normals (PoN). The PoN is a collection of BAM files from young individuals that are used to filter out false positives from the tumor samples by representing a base threshold of noise. Typically, 10 to 20 samples yields the best performance for the PoN.

Two separate filters are generated from the PoN:

<ol>
Threshold of Noise: This is a Bonferroni corrected Fisher's Exact Test that is used to determine the threshold of noise for the PoN. This is used to filter out any variants that are found in the tumor samples at a lower frequency than the threshold of noise.
Potential Germline Variants: These are non-hotspot variants that are found in 2 or more of the PoN samples at a 2% VAF or higher. These variants are then used to filter out any variants found in the tumor samples as possible germline variants.
</ol>
To generate the PoN, the following steps are required:

<ol>
Run the <a href="https://github.com/kbolton-lab/ArCH/blob/main/WDL/ArCH_Alignment.wdl">ArCH Alignment WDL Workflow</a> - This will create UMI consensus aligned BAM files for all the PoN samples.
Check the PoN Files for potential CH hotspots and remove them from the PoN samples.
</ol>
<pre><code># Using this Docker: duct/getbasecount:latest
docker run -v /path/to/PoN:/mnt duct/getbasecount:latest /opt/GetBaseCountsMultiSample/GetBaseCountsMultiSample --fasta $REF --bam ${sample_name}:/mnt/PoN.bam --vcf AnnotatePD_Files/bick_kelly_HGVSp5_pileup.vcf --output ${sample_name}.pileup.vcf --maq 5 --baq 5
bgzip ${sample_name}.pileup.vcf &amp;&amp; tabix ${sample_name}.pileup.vcf.gz

# Check the resulting pileup files for potential CH hotspots
bcftools view -i 'FORMAT/VF&gt;0.02' ${sample_name}.pileup.vcf.gz
</code></pre>
NOTE: For the variant: <code>chr20:32434638:A:AG</code>. Only remove the PoN Sample if this variant is found above 5% VAF in the PoN sample.

<ol>
Run the UMI Consensus Aligned BAM files through the <a href="https://github.com/kbolton-lab/ArCH/blob/main/WDL/pon2_creation.wdl">pon2_creation.wdl</a>
</ol>
This pipeline will generate 3 files:


mutect.2N.maxVAF.vcf.gz
lofreq.2N.maxVAF.vcf.gz
vardict.2N.maxVAF.vcf.gz

<h3>gnomAD Resource</h3>
Due to the size of gnomAD. The database is split into individual chromosomes. They will all have to be downloaded individually before merging them into a singular VCF file
Please go to the <a href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads#summary">official gnomAD download repository</a> to download the latest version of gnomAD (v4.1.0 - as of 05/30/2024)

<pre><code>for chr in {1..22} X Y; do
  bcftools view -f PASS -i 'INFO/AF&gt;=0.005' -Ou gnomad.exomes.v4.1.sites.chr${chr}.vcf.bgz | bcftools annotate -x ^INFO/AC,INFO/AF -Ou - | bcftools norm --multiallelics -any -Oz -o gnomad.exomes.v4.1.sites.chr${chr}.AF_only.exclude_0.005.normalized.vcf.gz -  
done

</code></pre>
<h3>VEP Cache</h3>
This Pipeline's annotation step has been configured to use VEP cache files, which can be downloaded from the <a>Ensembl FTP - Homo sapiens v109</a>. The cache files should be downloaded along with all necessary plugin files and zipped into a single file for the pipeline to use.

Create the VepData which will contain the VEP v109 Cache

<pre><code>mkdir VEP_cache &amp;&amp; mkdir VEP_cache/VepData;
cd VEP_cache;
curl -O ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-109/variation/indexed_vep_cache/homo_sapiens_merged_vep_109_GRCh38.tar.gz
tar xzf homo_sapiens_merged_vep_109_GRCh38.tar.gz -C VepData
rm homo_sapiens_merged_vep_109_GRCh38.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<pre><code>mkdir plugin

<h3>BCBio Filter Parameters</h3>
According to BCBIO, VarDict has multiple false positive calls at regions of low depth and allelic fractions. These are the <a href="https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen/blob/master/bcbio/variation/vardict.py#L251">default</a> parameters recommended by BCBIO. However, we have found that these parameters are too stringent for our purposes and have modified them to the following:

<pre><code>- Low mapping quality and multiple mismatches in a read (NM)
  For bwa only: MQ &lt; 55.0 and NM &gt; 1.0 or MQ &lt; 60.0 and NM &gt; 3.0
- Low depth (DP &lt; n) where n is calculated as 0.25 of the average read depth e.g. If the average read depth is 20,000 bp, then the n is 5000
- Low QUAL (QUAL &lt; 27)
</code></pre>
<h2>Output</h2>

|sample.final.annotated.tsv|The FINAL output file that contains all merged information from the pipeline|

<h2>Post Pipeline Steps</h2>
After the pipeline has finished running there should be several files that are generated. The final output file would be <code>${sample_name}.final.annotated.tsv</code>. All of these files generated for all the samples should be combined together into a final file using the following command

<pre><code># Grab the header from one of the output files
cat ${sample_name}.final.annotated.tsv | head -n1 &gt; final.combined.tsv

# Merge all output files together
for dir in $(ls -d */); do
  zcat $dir/${sample_name}.final.annotated.tsv | tail -n+2 &gt;&gt; final.combined.tsv;
done

# If the resulting file is too large, we can pre-filter the results prior to running our post filtering script
# Find the relative index position for the &quot;all_fp_pass&quot; filter
head -n1 final.combined.tsv | awk -F'\t' -vs='all_fp_pass' '{for (i=1;i&lt;=NF;i++)if($i~&quot;^&quot;s&quot;$&quot;){print i;exit;}}'

# For all of the output files, only keep the variants that had passed all our applied filters via checking the &quot;all_fp_pass&quot; column
# In this case, our column is index position 170
for dir in $(ls -d */); do 
  zcat $dir/${sample_name}.final.annotated.tsv | tail -n+2 | awk -F'\t' '{if($170==&quot;TRUE&quot;)print $0}' &gt;&gt; final.combined.FPpass.tsv; 
done

# Now the resulting final.combined.FPpass.tsv can be used as an input into our ArCHPostPipeline.R which can be run from this docker: kboltonlab/r_docker_ichan:latest
LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 Rscript --vanilla ArCHPostPipeline.R --tsv final.combined.FPpass.tsv --bolton_bick_vars AnnotatePD_Files/bick.bolton.vars3.txt --gene_list AnnotatePD_Files/oncoKB_CGC_pd_table_disparity_KB_BW.csv --cosmic AnnotatePD_Files/COSMIC.heme.myeloid.hotspot.w_truncating_counts.tsv --pd_table AnnotatePD_Files/pd_table_kbreview_bick_trunc4_oncoKB_SAFE.filtered_genes_oncoKB_CGC.tsv
</code></pre>
The output from ArCHPostPipeline.R will produce three output files:
|File|Description|
|---|---|
| final.all.csv | All variants that passed all post pipeline filters with additional annotations |
| final.pass.csv | Variants that passed all post pipeline filters and have been identified as potential CH variants that are putative drivers |
| final.review.csv | Variants that passed all post pipeline filters and could potentially be CH variants that are putative drivers, but need to be manually reviewed by an expert |

<h2>Limitations | TODO</h2>

VEP Annotations are hardcoded to work with the v109 cache be consistent so additional plugins or lack of plugins will cause issues with downstream annotation
