Description:
This simulated academic report was developed for HSS4101: Development and Evaluation of Health Programs at the University of Ottawa. It presents Safe Smiles, a conceptual school-based oral health initiative designed for neurodivergent students in the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB), including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ADHD, and other sensory sensitivities.

The project applies the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to conduct a community health needs assessment and outlines an inclusive oral health intervention with a logic model and evaluation plan. While the program itself is not implemented, it is grounded in real Canadian public health literature and reflects current gaps in oral health care access for neurodivergent youth.

Shared for educational and illustrative purposes to support learning, advocacy, and inclusive health promotion.
