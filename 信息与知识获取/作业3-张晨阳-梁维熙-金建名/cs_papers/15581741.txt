Description:
<em><span>English Language pronunciation is crucial in the student&rsquo;s learning process. The required pronunciation is geared toward the correct English Language phonological skills that are of concern to most linguists that English language learners whose first and second language is not English, hinder the learning processes. This paper focuses on the impact of phonological defects on Jita English language learners in Bunda Town Council, Tanzania. This qualitative and quantitative inquiry probes the complicated difficulties facing secondary-level learners of the English Language which if not well addressed, harden the English language learning process. Employing purposive sampling, this study chose 56 (40 students, 12 teachers and 4 heads of schools. The data were collected through closed questionnaires, sound test activities, and interviews. The collected data were analysed using percentages and frequencies. The challenges include priority conflicts, foundational inadequacies, educators&rsquo; limited proficiency, oversight of mispronunciations, temporal constraints, peer emulation, lack of educational resources, students&rsquo; reading limitations, and limited exposure. The study recommends prioritising phonological adequacy and correct pronunciation instruction, refining skills, integrating feedback, immersive practice, enriching resources, fostering reading habits, and using REALIA, which is &ldquo;real-world learning&rdquo; with the proper phonological drills in the teaching processes.</span></em>
