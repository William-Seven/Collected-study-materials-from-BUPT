Description:
Evaluation datasets, Python scripts, and computation environments used to conduct analyses for Simulated soundscapes and transfer learning boost the performance of acoustic classifiers under data scarcity.&nbsp;transfer_learning_project.zip also contains a vignette describing the use of a generalized script for adapting these methods to novel acoustic classification tasks.&nbsp;
