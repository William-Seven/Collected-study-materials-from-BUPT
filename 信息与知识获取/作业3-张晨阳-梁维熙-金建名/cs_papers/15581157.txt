Description:
<span lang="EN-US">this paper investigates the application of the Montessori method as an innovative pedagogical approach to enhance language learning skills among primary school students. Emphasizing learner autonomy, multisensory engagement, and individualized instruction, the Montessori framework provides a holistic and child-centered environment conducive to effective language acquisition during early educational stages. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, including observational studies, experimental implementation in classroom settings, and quantitative analysis of learner performance data. Findings reveal that Montessori-based language learning strategies significantly improve students&rsquo; vocabulary development, reading comprehension, speaking fluency, and overall linguistic competence. The paper discusses the implications of these results for curriculum design and pedagogical practice in primary education.</span>
