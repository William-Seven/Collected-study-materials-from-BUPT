Description:
<span lang="EN-US">The article explores the concept of dual education as reflected in Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s fiction, with a particular focus on his representations of robotics and technology. Dual education, understood as the integration of theoretical instruction with practical application, finds a compelling analogue in Asimov&rsquo;s narratives where humans and robots coexist, learn from one another, and contribute symbiotically to technological and societal development. Through a literary analysis of selected texts, the study demonstrates how Asimov&rsquo;s portrayal of education, human-robot interaction, and technological ethics provides a framework for rethinking contemporary educational models. </span>
