Description:
This study examines the impact of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) assessment and accreditation process on student learning outcomes in Indian higher education institutions. Through a comprehensive case study analysis of select Indian colleges, this research investigates how NAAC's quality assurance framework contributes to enhanced educational delivery and improved student performance. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, analyzing quantitative data from academic performance metrics and qualitative insights from stakeholder interviews across five colleges that underwent NAAC assessment between 2019-2023. Findings indicate significant improvements in curriculum design, teaching methodologies, infrastructure development, and overall institutional quality following NAAC accreditation. The research reveals that colleges with higher NAAC grades demonstrate measurably better student learning outcomes, including improved graduation rates, enhanced employability, and stronger research engagement. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on quality assurance in higher education and provides practical insights for educational administrators and policymakers seeking to enhance institutional effectiveness through systematic assessment processes.
