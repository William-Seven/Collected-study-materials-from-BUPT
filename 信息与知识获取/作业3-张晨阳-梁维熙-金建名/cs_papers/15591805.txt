Description:
<strong><span lang="EN-US">Abstract:</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"> This investigation was focused on the interactive communication compentencies of the children with Autism. These special children use the language specifically the syntax, semantic and pragmatic in the course of conversation and other situations like games, peer group activity and solving conflicts. The relationship between interactive communication competencies and socioeconomic status of children with autism of Special Education Center of Carcar City Central Elementary School was determined through descriptive quantitative research particularly the use of Chi-square of Independence. Findings revealed that critical tabled chi-square (82.45) is greater than the computed chi-square (51.58). This implied that there was no enough evidence to show that the socioeconomic status has bearing on the children&rsquo;s competencies. As the relationship between interactive communication competencies and socioeconomic status of the subjects, there was no significant relationship between under studied variables.</span>
