Description:
<em><span lang="EN-US">In the digital age, the traditional role of libraries as repositories of printed books is rapidly evolving to meet the dynamic needs of information seekers. Modern libraries have embraced digital technologies, transforming into hybrid spaces that combine physical resources with virtual services. They now function as community hubs, digital learning centers, and access points for e-resources, supporting lifelong learning and digital literacy. This transformation is driven by the increasing demand for open access information, the proliferation of online databases, and the need for equitable access to technology. Libraries play a critical role in bridging the digital divide, providing free internet access, training, and digital tools. Furthermore, they support research and innovation by offering digital archives, maker spaces, and collaboration areas. Librarians themselves are adopting new roles as digital curators, educators, and information technology facilitators. The evolving landscape demands continuous adaptation to emerging technologies and user expectations. As society becomes more information-centric, libraries remain essential institutions for knowledge dissemination and community engagement.</span></em>
