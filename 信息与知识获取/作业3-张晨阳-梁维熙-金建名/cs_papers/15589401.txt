Description:
<span lang="EN-US">This paper endeavors to examine the motivational impact derived from the incorporation of authentic materials within English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning environments. It further offers strategic recommendations for educators on how to structure such materials in ways that enhance learners&rsquo; comprehension and, consequently, sustain and elevate their motivational levels. In contemporary second language pedagogy, authentic materials have assumed a pivotal role due to their capacity to deliver meaningful linguistic input and expose learners to a diverse array of real-life content. This exposure not only stimulates interest but also fosters intrinsic motivation among students. Authentic materials have nowadays become an important part of second language classes mainly because they provide semantic input to students and enable them to interact with a wide variety of information that allows them not only to find inspiration but also to become motivated learners.</span>
