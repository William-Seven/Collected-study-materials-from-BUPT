These habits include waking up early, performing religious duties, exercising, eating healthy, being enthusiastic about learning, engaging in community activities, and resting on time. This study aims to analyze the role of parents in supporting the implementation of these habits, particularly among students at MTs Miftahul Ulum Karanganyar, as well as their impact on learning quality and children's character development.<span>&nbsp; </span>This research employs a qualitative method with a descriptive approach through observation, interviews, and case studies. The results indicate that collaboration between schools and parents is crucial in instilling these positive habits.
