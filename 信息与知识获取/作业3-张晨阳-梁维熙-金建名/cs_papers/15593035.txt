In an era of increasing classroom diversity, traditional physics instruction&mdash;often grounded in Eurocentric and decontextualized approaches&mdash;fails to meet the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse learners. This study explores the integration of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) in physics teacher preparation, emphasizing the importance of aligning physics education with students&rsquo; cultural experiences, identities, and community knowledge. Drawing on sociocultural learning theory and equity-oriented pedagogies, the paper highlights key CRT principles such as building on students&rsquo; cultural assets, maintaining high academic expectations, and fostering critical consciousness. The research underscores the challenges physics educators face in adopting CRT, including limited teacher preparation, curriculum rigidity, and misconceptions about academic rigor. To address these barriers, the study proposes strategies for embedding CRT into teacher education programs, including reflective practice, community-based learning, and curriculum redesign. By preparing future physics teachers to be culturally responsive, the study contributes to more inclusive, engaging, and effective science education, ultimately aiming to increase representation and success among historically marginalized student populations.
