Description:
<span>This document outlines the BBioNets Project's (BBioNets) Knowledge Transfer Activities (KTAs) and their role in implementing the "BBioNets for Everyone" concept, providing a clear overview of KTAs' objectives and contextual background. At the core of the KTAs are the Operational Groups (OGs) and their potential to support the dissemination and uptake of Bio-Based Technologies (BBTs). These activities aim to engage underrepresented groups -such as unemployed individuals, women, and youth- through the dedicated "BBioNets for Everyone" concept. The KTAs follow a phased approach beginning with broad content targeting general audiences and gradually evolving to address more specialized groups with increasingly tailored content.</span>

<span>KTAs planned within the framework of the BBioNets include:</span>
