Description:
The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) introduced outcome-based education (OBE) as a cornerstone of its revised accreditation framework in 2017, marking a paradigmatic shift from input-focused to outcome-oriented quality assessment in Indian higher education. This case study examines the strategic implications of NAAC's OBE approach through comprehensive analysis of five purposively selected higher education institutions across different categories and regions. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining institutional document analysis, stakeholder interviews, and performance data evaluation over a five-year period (2018-2023). Findings reveal that while OBE implementation has catalyzed significant strategic transformations including curriculum restructuring, assessment reforms, and faculty development initiatives, institutions face considerable challenges in operationalizing outcome measurement, ensuring stakeholder alignment, and sustaining long-term strategic commitment. The research identifies four critical strategic implications: institutional capacity building requirements, pedagogical transformation demands, stakeholder engagement complexities, and resource allocation adjustments. The study concludes that successful OBE implementation requires comprehensive strategic planning, sustained leadership commitment, and adaptive institutional cultures. These findings have significant implications for higher education policy, institutional strategic planning, and quality assurance frameworks in emerging economies.
