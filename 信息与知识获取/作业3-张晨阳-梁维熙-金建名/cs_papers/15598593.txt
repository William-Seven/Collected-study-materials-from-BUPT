Description:
<em><span lang="EN-US">In this article we will explore modern methods of foreign language teaching, with particular emphasis on communicative, technology-assisted, and interactive approaches. In contrast to traditional grammar-focused instruction, modern methodologies prioritize real-life communication, learner engagement, and the integration of digital tools. The communicative approach encourages students to actively use the target language in meaningful contexts, fostering fluency and confidence. Technology-assisted methods, including language learning apps, multimedia resources, offer flexible and immersive environments that cater to diverse learning styles. Interactive strategies such as group discussions, role-plays, and gamification not only enhance student motivation but also support collaborative learning. The study highlights how these modern techniques contribute to more effective language acquisition, especially among younger learners. By adopting such approaches, educators can create dynamic and student-centered learning environments that align with the needs of the 21st-century learner. The findings suggest that combining these methods leads to improved language proficiency and greater learner autonomy. This research aims to support language instructors in updating their pedagogical strategies to meet current educational demands. </span></em>
