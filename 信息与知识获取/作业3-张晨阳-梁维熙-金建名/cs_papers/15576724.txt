Description:
<span lang="EN-IN">The accelerating biodiversity crisis demands innovative and scalable approaches for effective ecological monitoring and conservation. Digital Guardians of Nature: Emerging AI Technologies in Plant and Animal Surveillance explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing plant and animal monitoring across diverse ecosystems. This chapter reviews cutting-edge AI methodologies, including deep learning, machine learning, and edge computing, applied to species identification, behavioral analysis, habitat mapping, and threat detection. We highlight the integration of AI with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and remote sensing platforms that enable real-time, non-invasive, and large-scale surveillance of flora and fauna. Key applications discussed include automated camera trap image classification, acoustic species recognition, drone-enabled wildlife monitoring, and predictive analytics for poaching prevention. Additionally, the chapter addresses critical ethical and technical challenges, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, infrastructure constraints, and environmental sustainability of AI deployment. By synthesizing recent advances and case studies, this work provides a comprehensive framework for harnessing AI as a powerful tool to safeguard biodiversity, facilitate informed conservation policies, and promote equitable and responsible environmental stewardship in an era of rapid global change.</span>
