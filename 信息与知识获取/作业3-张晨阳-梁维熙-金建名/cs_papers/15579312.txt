Description:
<span lang="EN-US">Three-Step Interview (TSI) is a cooperative learning strategy involving structured peer interaction, where students take turns as interviewers and interviewees, followed by group sharing. This study investigated the impact of the TSI on the mathematics engagement and performance of Grade 9 students at Tongantongan National High School, Valencia City, Bukidnon, for the academic year 2024- 2025. A quasi-experimental design was used, involving two intact sections: one exposed to TSI (n=50) and the other exposed to non-TSI (n=49). The data were collected using the Mathematics Engagement Scale and a teacher-made performance test.<span>&nbsp; </span>An analysis of Covariance was used to find statistical differences. The results indicated that both groups had the same engagement level before the intervention. However, after the intervention, students under the TSI improved across cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and social engagement domains. Overall, the engagement level of the TSI group was highly engaged (3.53) and moderately high (3.31) for the non-TSI. In addition, the level of mathematical performance in the pretest and the retention test of the TSI group was very low, and low for the posttest. Whereas the level of the non-TSI was very low across the pretest, posttest, and retention test.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there was no significant difference in the post-test performance, but the TSI group showed significantly better results on retention test scores and engagement. These findings suggest that TSI supports long-term learning and overall engagement. Future researchers </span><span lang="EN-GB">may extend the duration of TSI beyond six weeks to allow students more time to adapt and deepen engagement</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span>
