Description:
This repository contains the source code, model architectures, training/inference scripts, and environment files used in the manuscript <em>"Sparse Edge-Augmented Graph Transformer vs. Graph Attention Networks for Transonic Aerodynamic Predictions"</em>, currently under peer review.

It includes implementations of two models:



MeshGAT &ndash; a GAT-enhanced MeshGraphNet



AeroFormer &ndash; a physics aware sparse attention edge-augmented graph Transformer



The dataset structure, training logs, inference outputs, and environment specifications (YAML and requirements.txt) are provided to ensure reproducibility.
