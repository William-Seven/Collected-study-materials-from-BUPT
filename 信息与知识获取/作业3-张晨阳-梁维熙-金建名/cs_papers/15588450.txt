Description:
This package contains MATLAB scripts for the analysis and classification of digital ionogram images. The script <code>download_ionogram_DIDBase.m</code> enables bulk downloading of ionograms from the Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory (GIRO) database, specifically for station IL008. Users can modify the URL to download data from other stations.

The script <code>pro8_NNTrain.m</code>, adapted from Okoh (2024), was modified to support RGB ionogram images of size 600&times;900&times;3. It is used to train the convolutional neural network saved as <code>net_cnn_3_output_layers.mat</code>, which classifies ionograms into three categories:(i) ESF (Equatorial Spread F),(ii) Clear, and(iii) Unidentified.

The script <code>test_cnn_accuracy.m</code> evaluates the model's performance on an independent test set and displays the overall classification accuracy.
