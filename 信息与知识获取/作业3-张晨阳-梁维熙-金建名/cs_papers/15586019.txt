<span lang="EN-US">This study investigates the effectiveness of the P.U.S.H. (Pre-teaching Exercise, Use of Technology, Scope of Creativity, and Haggai Activity) Technique in enhancing the performance of Grade 8 learners in literature at Vicente Madrigal National High School. Using an experimental design, two groups were compared: the control group used direct instruction, while the experimental group employed the P.U.S.H. Technique. Findings reveal significant improvements in the experimental group's performance across Afro-Asian literature topics. The study concludes that the P.U.S.H. Technique is effective in bridging learning gaps and enhancing student achievement in literature.</span>
