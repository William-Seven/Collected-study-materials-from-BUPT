<h2>Abstract:</h2>
Introduction: In the context of the current educational system, it is necessary to apply methodologies that respond to the needs of the school population. Pedagogical models are configured as optimal resources to meet the needs of schoolchildren. Aim: The aim of this research was to find out the participants' perception of their behaviours associated with the levels of the Personal and Social Responsibility Model, after an intervention based on the hybridisation of this model together with Cooperative Learning. Method: The thumb test was used to find out the level of responsibility perceived by the students. Results and discussion: The results were positive for each of the personal and social values studied. These coincide with previous research showing the positive influence of both models on these values. Conclusion: It is recommended to apply this type of hybridisation of models in both the educational and scientific spheres, given the benefits shown in the students' self-perception of their behaviour.
