Description:
The study titled primarily sought to describe the profile of respondents taking BS Nursing, BSMLS, and BS Pharmacy whether they were On-Track or Off-Track; determine the academic difficulties encountered by On-Track and Off-Track first year college students in the four areas of Understanding Content, Basic Skills Requirements, Motivation, and Study Time; determine the level of academic difficulties encountered by the respondents; and determine whether there is a significant difference in the academic difficulties encountered by On-Track and Off-Track students in their first year of study at SLRC. The proposed action plan targets both On-Track and Off-Track first year college students of SLRC Ormoc and primarily aims at improving students&rsquo; mastery in basic science concepts in chemistry, physics, and biology. The study sought to examine the academic difficulties of On-Track and Off-Track college students of San Lorenzo Ruiz College of Ormoc. Overall t-test results (1.072) revealed no significant difference on the level of difficulties encountered by the On-Track and Off-Track first year college students among the different areas of academic difficulty. Based on the results and findings of the study, it is concluded that regardless if students are On-Track or Off-Track, they experienced academic difficulty in their College life. These difficulties however are minimized when students have strong motivation to study. The school environment can help students cope with their academic difficulties by designing different mechanisms to address these difficulties.
