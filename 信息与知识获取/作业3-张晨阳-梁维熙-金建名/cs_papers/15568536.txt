Description:
<strong><span lang="EN-US">Abstract:</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"> This study is aimed at investigating the significant relationship between teachers&rsquo; emotional intelligence, readiness in teaching practices, and effectiveness on handling learners with difficulty in remembering, concentrating, paying attention and understanding in the selected 7 public elementary schools in the Department of Education, Division of Davao City. It employed quantitative predictive research design which describes the relationship between two or more variables. Primary data was obtained by using adapted survey questionnaires among 200 teachers. Standardized Emotional Intelligence Test and teacher readiness survey questionnaires were utilized in this study. This study utilized Mean, Standard Deviation, correlation analysis through Pearson product-moment correlation, and multiple regression analysis. Results revealed a very high level and there is strong positive correlation among the variables. In addition, emotional intelligence does not significantly influence teachers&rsquo; effectiveness while readiness in teaching practices have positive influence on teachers&rsquo; effectiveness in handling learners with learning disabilities. This further implies that while emotional intelligence may be beneficial, it is the practical readiness in teaching practices that play more a crucial role in addressing the learning needs of learners. Hence, this research recommends targeted interventions in teacher preparation programs in order to foster emotional intelligence and teaching readiness and, eventually, create a more welcoming and productive learning environment.</span>
