Description:
<strong><span lang="EN-US">Abstract:</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"> This study investigated factors influencing the teaching of the throwing method in ceramics among secondary school learners in Mufulira District, Copperbelt Province, Zambia. The objectives were to assess teacher expertise, examine resource availability, explore the impact of attitudes on learning outcomes, and suggest strategies for improvement. A mixed methods approach was used, involving 105 participants and data collected via questionnaires and interviews. The quantitative data obtained were analyzed using software such as SPSS whereas the qualitative date were analyzed using study themes. The study findings found that the teaching of the throwing method in ceramics under Art and Design in selected secondary schools is influenced by a range of interrelated factors that hinder effective instruction and skill acquisition. One major factor is the lack of adequate teaching and learning materials, such as potter&rsquo;s wheels, quality clay, and glazing equipment, which are essential for practical training. Additionally, limited infrastructure and inadequate classroom space constrain the proper setup of functional art studios necessary for ceramic work. Another key challenge is the shortage of qualified and specialized Art and Design teachers who possess the technical skills and pedagogical knowledge to effectively teach the throwing method. The study therefore recommended that the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with school administrations and relevant stakeholders, prioritize the provision of specialized teaching materials and equipment such as potter&rsquo;s wheels, quality clay, and functional art studios.</span>
