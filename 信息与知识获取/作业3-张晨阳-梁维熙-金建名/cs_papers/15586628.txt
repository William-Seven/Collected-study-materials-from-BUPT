<h4>Abstract :</h4>
This paper proposes a conceptual framework to explain how informal learning through social media influences creative development among theatre‐major students in Beijing, China. Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory, the model positions aesthetic ability&mdash;defined as the capacity to perceive, interpret, and critically evaluate artistic stimuli&mdash;as the key mechanism linking students&rsquo; use of platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu to their creative output. After reviewing literature on digital pedagogy, creativity in performing arts, and aesthetic development, the paper identifies three core relationships: (1) social media use in learning positively impacts aesthetic ability; (2) enhanced aesthetic ability, in turn, fosters greater creativity; and (3) social media use exerts an indirect effect on creativity via the mediating role of aesthetic ability. Although the framework is conceptual, it offers clear directions for future empirical research, recommending cross‐sectional survey designs, validated Likert‐scale measures, and structural equation modeling to test these hypotheses. The study contributes to theory by integrating aesthetic cognition into models of digital learning and creativity, and to practice by suggesting that theatre educators deliberately incorporate curated social media content and reflective activities to cultivate students&rsquo; aesthetic sensitivity and creative confidence. Finally, it underscores the relevance of media literacy and aesthetic education as integral components of 21st-century arts curricula.
