<a name="_Hlk199428791"></a><strong><span lang="EN-US">Abstract:</span></strong> <a name="_Hlk167038890"></a><span><span><span lang="EN-US">This concept paper proposes a career intervention for collegiate student-athletes to aid in their process of transitioning to a non-athletic career setting after their exit from their sport participation in college. It aims to address the lack of awareness of this population in terms of the transferable skills which they have learned and mastered through their sport and how these skills can be useful while they navigate the world of work. The intervention will focus on creating awareness of the skills they possess, boosting their confidence that these skills make them career-ready and employable, and introducing them to career resources and learning opportunities that can help them solidify the transferable skills that they&rsquo;ve gained through their sport. The intervention will be guided by the Life Development Intervention (LDI) model by Danish, Petitpas and Hale (1993) who recognized that there are critical life events that may prompt an athlete to transition out of sports, and it is where the utilization of their transferable skills for continued growth and successful adaptation to a new setting will be relevant. They identified a three-step process in which counselors can help influence student-athletes to recognize their skills that are acquired through sports, how they are developed in the sports context, identify settings out of sport where they have utilized those same skills </span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-PH">and how to apply them more specifically in a non-athletic career setting. The specific strategies that will be employed to attain these targets include development of </span><span lang="EN-US">self and career exploration modules, use of Transferable Skills Inventory, workshops and learning sessions, tapping of former student-athletes as resource for career talks, exposure and participation in career events in campus, introducing them to internships and volunteer work, career mentoring and career counseling. Over-all, the intervention hopes to contribute to the career-readiness and employability of collegiate student-athletes.</span></span></span>
