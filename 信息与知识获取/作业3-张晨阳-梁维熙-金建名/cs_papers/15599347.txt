Description:
<em><span lang="EN-US">This study examines the potential of TED-Ed as a supplementary educational resource for enhancing the four primary language skills&mdash;listening, speaking, reading, and writing&mdash;through the engagement with short, thematic videos. TED-Ed, a platform known for its animated educational content, offers a variety of videos across different subjects that are designed to engage learners while simultaneously improving their language proficiency. By integrating TED-Ed into language learning environments, this research investigates how watching brief yet thought-provoking videos can positively influence language acquisition and skill development. The study focuses on the following key aspects: Listening &ndash; how TED-Ed videos, with their diverse speakers and clear narration, help learners enhance their auditory comprehension and ability to grasp different accents and dialects; Speaking &ndash; how learners can use the content as a basis for discussions, presentations, and debates to improve fluency and conversational skills; Reading &ndash; how subtitles and video transcripts support reading comprehension, vocabulary expansion, and syntactic understanding; and Writing &ndash; how learners can be encouraged to summarize, critique, or respond to the videos in writing, thereby improving their writing skills, organization, and critical thinking. Furthermore, this study explores the advantages of TED-Ed&rsquo;s engaging format, which motivates learners by presenting real-world knowledge and cultural insights in a digestible manner. The interactive nature of TED-Ed videos encourages active learning, fostering curiosity and deeper intellectual engagement, while promoting the development of language skills in a contextualized environment. The research concludes that TED-Ed can be an invaluable tool in supplementing traditional language education by offering an accessible and dynamic means of reinforcing the four key skills, enhancing both learner engagement and proficiency.</span></em>
