Description:
<em><span lang="EN-US">This review paper examines the transformative role of libraries in the knowledge society, emphasizing their contribution to educational excellence and human development. As societies transition from industrial to knowledge-based economies, libraries evolve from traditional book repositories to dynamic hubs of digital literacy, lifelong learning, and inclusive access. The study explores key themes, including the shift from print to digital services, the integration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and libraries' role in bridging the digital divide. It highlights challenges such as technological gaps, funding constraints, and policy neglect, which hinder libraries' potential. Despite these limitations, libraries remain vital in fostering critical thinking, research support, and community empowerment. The paper concludes with recommendations for strengthening libraries as strategic enablers of education and societal progress in the digital age.</span></em>
