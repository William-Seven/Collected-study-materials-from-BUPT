Description:
We are thrilled to welcome readers to the Proceedings of the 6th Crossing Boundaries in Vocational Education and Training conference. This dynamic scholarly event unites researchers for meaningful dialogue on vocational education and training. The contributions' diversity and quality showcase the research field's rich perspectives and the enduring significance of VET as a catalyst for educational, economic, and social change. We believe this volume will inspire fruitful discussions and encourage shared learning across various contexts, traditions, and disciplines &ndash; both during the conference and afterwards.

This volume features 70 contributions that reflect the diverse and evolving field of VET research in 2025. Centred on the theme &ldquo;Towards Inclusive and Egalitarian Vocational Education and Training: Key Challenges and Strategies from a Holistic and Multi-Contextual Approach&ldquo;, the papers tackle critical issues related to access, participation, educational outcomes, and reforms in VET across various regions and contexts.

What emerges is a colourful mosaic of viewpoints that cross disciplinary, methodological, and national boundaries. Collectively, they express a strong commitment to reevaluating VET as not just a means for labour market integration, but as a space for personal growth, social inclusion, and democratic engagement.

A key issue highlighted in many papers is the impact of structural inequalities on participation in various VET pathways and their associated career prospects. Several studies indicate persistent trends of gender segregation, socio-economic divides, and challenges faced by migrants. Additionally, some studies explore how vocational aspirations develop and are limited across different educational systems and emphasise that targeted support, along with acknowledgement of learners&rsquo; backgrounds and goals, can enhance participation and outcomes.

Another key focus is on transitions and trajectories &ndash; not just from school to work, but throughout the life course. Whether examining early vocational decision-making, adult learning, or mid-career upskilling, many contributions emphasise the need for VET systems to accommodate diverse and non-linear educational journeys. This necessitates more flexible offerings, guidance structures, and recognition mechanisms that are aligned with learners&rsquo; realities.

The development of VET professionals represents a third major strand. Several papers argue that inclusive VET needs a redefinition of the roles and skills of teachers, trainers, and guidance personnel. There is an emerging agreement that VET professionals require assistance to address the increasing diversity of learners alongside the evolving challenges of digitalisation, sustainability, and work-based learning.

Whether in urban areas or rural settings, and across dual systems or school-based models, the papers collectively explore how policy, culture, and context influence the opportunities and challenges of inclusive VET. Additionally, multiple contributions suggest specific strategiessuch as curriculum reform, participatory governance, and cross-sectoral collaboration&mdash;that can effectively address ongoing gaps.

A particularly noteworthy feature of this volume is the consistent effort to reflect across contexts. Many authors engage in critical dialogue with practices and findings from other countries, fostering a shared learning culture.

Taken together, the papers emphasise the essential role of VET in addressing societal challenges. They also highlight that unlocking the potential of VET demands ongoing critical reflection and a steadfast commitment to equity, quality, and inclusion. This volume aids this effort &ndash; serving as an academic resource, reflecting ongoing discussions, and inviting collaborative action across boundaries.

Participants were selected based on the submission of a proposal for the conference, which underwent a rigorous double-blind review conducted by members of the VETNET community. Upon acceptance, participants were required to submit a short full paper prior to the conference, which was included in this volume of proceedings. Submitting a paper was a prerequisite for conference participation. Each short paper received additional feedback in preparation for publication. Specifically, papers were read and commented on by the editorial team and a critical friend &ndash; another participant of the conference &ndash; who engaged constructively with the work. This collaborative review structure reflects the spirit of the Crossing Boundaries conference: fostering dialogue, critical reflection, and joint learning.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our VETNET colleagues for their support during the review process &ndash; without their contributions, this publication would not have been ready in time for the conference. Above all, we thank the authors and co-authors for their commitment and scholarly engagement. Their work forms the heart of this volume. While the conference papers are published as edited volume, full responsibility for content and copyright remains with the respective authors.

We would also like to warmly acknowledge the invaluable contributions of all members of the Vocational Education and Training Research and Innovation Laboratory (LABVET) at the University of the Balearic Islands. Their dedication, creativity, and commitment were instrumental in shaping and delivering this conference. The event would not have been possible without their tireless efforts and collaborative spirit.

Our heartfelt thanks also go to CaixaBank Dualiza, the Department of Applied Pedagogy and Educational Psychology, and the Institute for Educational Research and Innovation at the University of the Balearic Islands. Their generous financial and institutional support made it possible to bring together a diverse international community of researchers and to share their work through this publication.

We hope you find the papers in this volume inspiring and thought-provoking. Our desire is that they ignite fresh ideas, stimulate critical reflection, and promote ongoing dialogue within the VET research community. We eagerly anticipate welcoming you to the next Crossing Boundaries conference in 2027, which presents another chance to advance our collective journey toward inclusive and progressive vocational education and training. Additional details will be shared in due course on https://vetnetsite.org.
