Description:
<span lang="EN-US">Better teacher selection and preparation will result from identifying the traits and attributes of a successful teacher. The standard of a teacher is inadequate, particularly when it comes to their general knowledge, intelligence, and professional competence. The study's objective is to offer an analytical perspective on teachers' lack of interest and how it affects the learning environment. Some general qualities that a good teacher should possess are normal physical and mental health, a well-balanced philosophical and cultural outlook, normal general intelligence, good daily habits, sociability, and emotional maturity. Specific qualities that a good teacher should possess include subject-matter knowledge, the ability to impart knowledge, empathy and love for students, leadership, and communication skills. To put it briefly, a competent teacher is one who can handle the duties involved in organizing, directing, and assessing the educational system. He is a decent man with strong cultural values who feels that his work is vital to the advancement of both his town and the country as a whole.</span>
