Its goal is to organize these experiences to facilitate comparative analysis, identify best practices, and support the development of new educational projects involving open knowledge and active learning strategies.

The mapping table available on this page is the result of an extensive two-year research effort, involving the analysis of over 20,000 educational projects related to the use of Wikipedia in higher education. Despite the systematic effort and methodological rigor applied, the volume, diversity, and limitations in accessing consistent data ultimately compromised the final consolidation of the table, especially after the research funding ended. Therefore, we recommend that the table be consulted with caution and critical thinking, bearing in mind that some information may be incomplete or inaccurate. A broader contextualization of the results, as well as reflections on the challenges faced, can be found in the project's final report: https://w.wiki/DeBS .
