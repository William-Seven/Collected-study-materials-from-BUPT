Description:
<em><span>Libraries have an underappreciated position in an era where tools like&ensp;Google are the prerogative digital search engine. In this paper, we will emphasize the distinct roles libraries play in providing access&ensp;to reliable, curated content and developing critical thinking skills and working toward lifelong learning. It stitches together a comparison between the segmented, algorithmically-ordered content we find on search engines and the organized, expert-pedagogically direct study spaces we find in&ensp;libraries. It addresses challenges such as limited funding and evolving user expectations, alongside examples of innovative responses such as digital&ensp;literacy programs and AI-assisted services. It ends with a re-emphasis of the continuing relevance of libraries, and a call that policy should be directed towards strengthening their role in equitable and meaningful&ensp;dissemination of knowledge.</span></em>
