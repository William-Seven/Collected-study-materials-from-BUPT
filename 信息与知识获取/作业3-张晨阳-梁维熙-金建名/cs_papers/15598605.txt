Description:
<em><span lang="RU">In a world that is ever more interconnected and globalized, proficiency in foreign languages has shifted from an academic objective to a required life skill. This paper explores the major changes that have occurred in language-specific pedagogies in the 21st century and, in particular, it describes the transition from traditional grammar-translation styles to modern human-centered pedagogies like Communicative Language Teaching (CLT), task-based learning, and, where appropriate, digital pedagogies. We rely on contemporary research to show how these new forms of pedagogy are helping students to speak more fluently, have more confidence when communicating, and develop intercultural competence, particularly in multicultural and multilingual contexts. Also the growing developments in educational technology, including mobile applications, AI, and online platforms, and how these have further enhanced students' engagement with language learning, especially in the context of global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic will be looked at. </span></em>
