Description:
<em><span lang="EN-US">This article examines the integration of comparative linguistics and neurolinguistics fields, their interrelationship and their role in linguistics. The research analyzes the basic principles of comparative linguistics and neurolinguistics theory and methodology and demonstrates the possibilities of connecting modern linguistic processes with human brain activity. Furthermore, as a result of the integration of the two fields, new approaches emerge in language evolution, neurophysiological mechanisms of language, language learning, and language therapy. The research results have practical significance for language education, clinical linguistics, and neuropedagogy.</span></em>
