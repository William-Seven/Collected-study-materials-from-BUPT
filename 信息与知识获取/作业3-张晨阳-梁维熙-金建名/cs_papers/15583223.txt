Description:
Achieving common prosperity for all people is the essential requirement of Chinese-style modernization, and the weakest key link at present is the common prosperity of farmers and rural areas. Taking Guzhu Village in Changxing County as a typical case, this paper adopts the longitudinal single case study method to explore the process, operation mode and mechanism of the village's road to common prosperity from the perspective of symbiosis theory. The results show that: (1) Guzhu Village has experienced different stages of development in the process of common prosperity, and each stage has produced different symbiotic effects. Individual villagers have given birth to the bud of rural development, but their lack of knowledge, cognition and management ability can't achieve high-quality rural development. The gradual participation of the government, associations and operating companies has injected new energy into promoting rural areas towards common prosperity. (2) The village focuses on multiple symbiotic subjects and operates collaboratively with the help of symbiotic environment. Effective collaboration between symbiotic units has become the key to rural common prosperity. The symbiotic model respects the core position of villagers, effectively promotes the participation and recognition of all villagers, turns the ecological advantages and resource advantages in the village into economic advantages and development advantages, and realizes the villagers' material wealth, spiritual and cultural wealth and ecological harmony in the village. Research suggestions: In the process of rural development, we can inject new energy into the village by maintaining the dominant position of villagers, introducing new units such as operating companies, making full use of resource endowments to broaden the path of increasing income and getting rich, giving full play to the synergy among symbiotic units, and jointly strengthening the rural collective economy.
