Description:
Code written by: Shraddha Naidu (DatasetGenerator/Backprojection/Bump Functions) and David J. McMahon (Forward Map/Bump Functions)

This release contains the complete codebase for the simulation and generation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The SAR data is generated from a virtual antenna flying at a height of&nbsp;<strong>5 meters</strong>&nbsp;along a&nbsp;<strong>circular flight path</strong>, with additional simulated passes at two other altitudes.

<h3>üîç&nbsp;<strong>Features</strong></h3>

SAR signal modeling and simulation
Synthetic data acquisition along a circular flight trajectory
Phase-only SAR image reconstruction (backprojection)
Support for generating terrain images from three antenna heights

<h3>üõ†&nbsp;<strong>Usage</strong></h3>
To generate a dataset, call the following function:

<div>
<pre>SAR_Dataset_Generation(number_of_samples)</pre>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
This function:


Simulates SAR phase-only data
Reconstructs images via backprojection
Saves the generated data and images for analysis

<h3>üßæ&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong></h3>

Only&nbsp;<strong>phase data</strong>&nbsp;is used&mdash;amplitude is not included.
The output images are&nbsp;<strong>phase-only reconstructions</strong>.
Ideal for SAR imaging research and algorithm development.
