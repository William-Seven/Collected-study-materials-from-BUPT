Description:
Abstract: A persistent challenge in theatre education is effectively translating theoretical knowledge into practical competence.Educational field trips offer a potential solution by providing experiential learning opportunities. This qualitative study investigated the&nbsp;impact of such a field trip on the attitudes, learning, and engagement of level 100 Theatre Studio students in the Department of Theatre&nbsp;Arts, University of Education, Winneba in 2015. Employing experiential learning theories as a framework, data were gathered through&nbsp;semi-structured interviews, field notes, and document analysis. The analysis revealed three key themes: enhanced student confidence&nbsp;and teamwork; a deeper comprehension and appreciation of theatrical production processes; and the acquisition of practical skills in&nbsp;observation, analysis, and technical domains. The findings indicate that well-designed field trips, encompassing pre-trip preparation,&nbsp;in-trip activities, and post-trip reflection, significantly improve learning outcomes and cultivate a stronger connection to theatre&nbsp;practice. While the study&rsquo;s sample size of sixty participants is a limitation, it underscores the significant potential of experiential&nbsp;learning within theatre education and suggests directions for future research within the Theatre Studio curriculum.
