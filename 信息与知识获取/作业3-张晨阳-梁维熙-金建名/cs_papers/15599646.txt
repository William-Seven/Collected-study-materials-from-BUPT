Description:
Abstract-STEM(Science,Technology,engineering, and Math) education today incorporates the use of AI Chatbots that has been embraced as a most suitable and friendly companion in today&rsquo;s learning process. Though it cannot be denied that&nbsp;they have their benefits, this work is aimed at discussing the aspect of how the excessive usage, particularly among the youth, has affected society. This paper identifies chatbot usage in the learning process of adolescents and the efficiency of STEM&nbsp;(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) using possible side effects apart from memorization. Therefore , it is possible to conclude that there might be the following disadvantages when it comes to the use of chatbots in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education for teenagers and it is important for teachers, policymakers, and parents to know potential trade-off associated with this technology. The aim is to contribute, in a way, to the understanding of how chatbots can enhance&nbsp;learning support and how STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education could be developed appropriately and naturally to have a positive effect on the teens, thereby preparing them for future technology-oriented society
