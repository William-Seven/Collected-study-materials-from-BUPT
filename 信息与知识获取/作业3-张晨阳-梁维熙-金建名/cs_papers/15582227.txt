Description:
Entrepreneurship is pivotal in creating job opportunities at the macroeconomic level, serving as a cornerstone of socio-economic progress. At the individual level, it acts as a vital source of income. This research focuses on the impact of attitudes towards entrepreneurial success and failure on the entrepreneurial intentions of university students. It also explores the moderating role of market prospects in this context. Our findings reveal that a positive attitude towards entrepreneurial success significantly boosts entrepreneurial intentions, whereas fear and anxiety about failure have a negative influence. Market prospects, when considered as a control variable, show a notable negative effect when combined with negative attitudes towards failure, indicating that fear of failure further weakens entrepreneurial intentions in unfavorable market conditions. Failure plays a crucial role in shaping entrepreneurial intentions. Through this study, we seek to offer comprehensive guidance to university students in entrepreneurship and foster the healthy development of entrepreneurial endeavors.
