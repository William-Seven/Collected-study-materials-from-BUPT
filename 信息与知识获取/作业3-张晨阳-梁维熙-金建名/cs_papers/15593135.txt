Description:
<span lang="EN-US">Intelligent analysis of video data encompasses a variety of techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and real-time processing. These methods are designed to automate the detection, categorization, and enhancement of video content, ensuring seamless transmission and high-quality viewing experiences. For instance, deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are extensively used for content recognition and anomaly detection in video streams[1].</span>
