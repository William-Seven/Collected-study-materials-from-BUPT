Description:
This study investigates the effectiveness of two formative assessment strategies&mdash;live marking and Socrative&mdash;in enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes in secondary science classrooms. Conducted in a Birmingham academy school, the study responds to the increasing demand for assessment tools that provide real-time feedback and support responsive teaching. Using a case study design and an interpretivist paradigm, data were gathered from teacher interviews, student questionnaires, classroom observations, and field notes. Thematic and graphical analysis revealed that live marking fostered immediate feedback, improved student motivation, and supported differentiation, particularly for SEND students. Socrative&rsquo;s real-time data visualisation encouraged self-assessment and active participation, although challenges such as screen fatigue and distractions were noted. Despite time and resource constraints, triangulating feedback from teachers, students, and observations ensured robust insights. The study concludes that these AfL techniques, when implemented thoughtfully, foster inclusive, data-informed teaching that enhances science learning. Implications include the need for balanced integration of digital and traditional tools, tailored feedback strategies, and teacher training to optimise impact. The findings offer practical guidance for science educators aiming to refine formative assessment practices.<span>&nbsp;</span>
