Description:
<span lang="EN-US">The effects of the home learning environment (HLE) on the development and growth of kindergarten learners in the Marinduque Schools Division during the 2023&ndash;2024 academic year was investigated in this study. The study, which was based on Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, looked at how home routines, parental background, the physical learning environment, and the availability of learning resources affect young children's growth and development in areas like fine and gross motor skills, self-help, receptive and expressive language, cognitive abilities, and social-emotional abilities. Pre-, mid-, and post-assessment surveys and assessments were used to gather data from a subset of central and non-central schools using a quantitative descriptive research design. The findings indicated that children's early development is significantly affected by the quality of the home learning environment, especially by parental participation, access to educational resources, and established routines. Effective home learning has been found to be hampered by issues like a lack of resources, time constraints, and parents' differing educational backgrounds. To overcome these obstacles, parents also used a variety of tactics, such as better time management, creative material creation, and greater involvement in their kids' education. To promote the holistic development of kindergarten pupils in rural areas, the study's conclusion suggested creating a contextualized home learning environment model. To support equitable early childhood education and development, these findings highlight the significance of enabling parents and communities to establish favorable home learning environments, particularly in low-resource areas.</span>
