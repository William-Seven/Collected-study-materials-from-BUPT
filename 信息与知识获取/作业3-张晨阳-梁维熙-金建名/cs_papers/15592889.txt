Abstract:&nbsp;

<span>As careers progress, professional development needs shift - often in unexpected ways. For mid-career archaeologists, the skills required increasingly extend beyond traditional archaeological training. This paper explores the evolving learning landscape for these professionals, highlighting the growing importance of accessing knowledge and training from outside the conventional boundaries of academic archaeology. Drawing on the author's own journey, it offers a case study in how managers within archaeological </span><span>organisations</span><span> can identify, pursue, and apply professional development opportunities that equip them to lead in a changing field.</span>
