Description:

The zipped file wind_analysis.zip contains datasets and scripts used for the characterization of the wind and runup disturbance. This toolbox generates Fig1c-h of the manuscript and contains: i) The matlab scripts Fig1_generator.m (the main script), extract_new.m; ii) Eleven folders containing the &nbsp;shapefiles of the offshore zones and the NetCDF files of the ERA5 hourly signals for the period 2019-2022. 


This zipped file validation_toolbox.zip contains datasets and scripts used for the validation: i) The matlab scripts Fig4_generator.m (the main script), model_realcase.m, extract.m; ii) Four folders containing all the dataset of the pilot areas, including shapefiles of the terrestrial areas, shapefiles of the offshore zone, &nbsp;NetCDF files of the ERA5 hourly signals, mean transect profile, Planet cover profile, Sentinel2 cover profile, high-resolution DEMs.
