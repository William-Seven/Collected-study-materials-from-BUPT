Description:

<span>Purpose: This review explores the growing role of New Generation Probiotics (NGPs) in the gut-brain axis, emphasizing their potential to enhance mental and cognitive functions. The primary research question examines how specific probiotic strains in NGPs influence neuroinflammatory processes, neurotransmitter production, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, all of which are integral to brain health and emotional well-being. Methods: This review consolidates recent findings from clinical and laboratory studies on NGPs, particularly those containing strains like Faecalibacterium faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis. The review also evaluates innovative probiotic delivery mechanisms, such as encapsulation technology and psychological integration, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Results: Current evidence suggests that New Generation Probiotics (NGPs) can positively impact mental health by alleviating stress and anxiety, improving cognitive abilities like memory, and supporting emotional development. Furthermore, new delivery strategies for probiotics are enhancing their therapeutic effectiveness in treating various conditions. Conclusion: New Generation Probiotics (NGPs) represent a promising approach for addressing neurological and psychological disorders. While they offer significant potential benefits for mental health, concerns regarding safety and regulation persist. Ongoing collaborative research is essential to refine New Generation Probiotics (NGP) based therapies and translate them into real-world clinical applications.</span>
