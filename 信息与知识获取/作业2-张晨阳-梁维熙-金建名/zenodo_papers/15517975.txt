Description:

<em><span lang="EN-US">This study investigates the economic impact of tourism on the development of local enterprises in Uzbekistan, focusing on small and medium-sized businesses in key cultural and historical regions such as Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, and the Fergana Valley. By employing a mixed-methods approach, including both statistical data analysis and field interviews with local entrepreneurs, the research identifies how tourism contributes to business growth, job creation, and regional income diversification. Findings reveal that the expansion of tourism infrastructure and international visitor inflows have significantly increased demand for hospitality services, handicrafts, transport, and local cuisine. However, the study also highlights challenges such as unequal regional benefits, seasonal dependency, and limited access to financial and digital resources for rural entrepreneurs. The paper concludes by recommending policies aimed at promoting sustainable tourism development, improving business support systems, and enhancing the integration of local enterprises into national tourism strategies.</span></em>
