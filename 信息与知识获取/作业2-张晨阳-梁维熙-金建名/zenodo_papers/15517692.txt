Description:

Antenatal care (ANC) is an essential intervention for enhancing mother and child
health; yet, its adoption continues to pose a considerable obstacle, especially in rural and
underserved areas such as Cuttack district, Odisha. This study investigates the facilitators
and obstacles to antenatal care services in this region, with the objective of identifying
factors that affect maternal healthcare consumption. The study examines the influence of
accessibility, awareness initiatives, governmental regulations, and community assistance on
the adoption of antenatal care, while also emphasizing the cultural, economical, and
geographical barriers that impede service utilization. Essential facilitators comprise the
development of healthcare infrastructure, including primary health centers and mobile health
units, in conjunction with awareness campaigns and supportive governmental efforts like as
Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA).
Obstacles encompass cultural convictions that prefer home births, economic limitations,
considerable distances to healthcare institutions, and insufficient service quality. The study
highlights the necessity of focused efforts to overcome these obstacles and increase ANC
utilization, hence improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. Recommendations
encompass broadening healthcare access, improving service quality, and augmenting
community engagement to guarantee that all women have sufficient antenatal care.&nbsp;
