<em><span>Antenatal care (ANC) is an essential component of maternal healthcare that significantly contributes to the prevention of problems and the promotion of healthy pregnancies. Notwithstanding its significance, the utilization of ANC services remains irregular, especially in rural and neglected regions of India, including the Cuttack district of Odisha. This study seeks to examine the obstacles and enablers affecting ANC utilization in Cuttack. The research finds major determinants influencing women's access to antenatal care services through an examination of socioeconomic, cultural, healthcare system, and community aspects. Socioeconomic characteristics, including income, education, and employment position, substantially influence ANC utilization, with women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds encountering larger obstacles in receiving care. Cultural views and traditional traditions, such as preferences for home births or dependence on traditional medicine, significantly influence women's decisions. Furthermore, although government initiatives such as Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) have enhanced healthcare accessibility, challenges pertaining to infrastructure, budgetary limitations, and gender norms persist in obstructing antenatal care (ANC) utilization. The research underscores the significance of familial and communal support in promoting or hindering antenatal care usage. The findings indicate that overcoming these obstacles necessitates comprehensive initiatives, including the enhancement of healthcare infrastructure, the promotion of awareness, and the facilitation of community engagement to achieve improved maternal health outcomes in the region.</span></em>
