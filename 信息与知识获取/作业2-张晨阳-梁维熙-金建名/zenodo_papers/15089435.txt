Description:

The radar data is from the MBR7 (vertically pointing), MBR5 (scan), and RPG94 (vertically pointing) is in the respective folders within the folder called &ldquo;radar_data&rdquo;. The data were used for reflectivity, spectral width, SLDR, rimed mass fraction, EDR, Doppler spectra, peakTree, and the VDPS method.


The ICON-D2 data is available from the DWD data center upon request (ICON-D2 Documentation, 2024).


The VISSS data used in the study is given in the folder &ldquo;VISSS_data&rdquo;. More information on the processing of the VISSS data can be found in&nbsp;Maahn, M., Moisseev, D., Steinke, I., Maherndl, N., and Shupe, M. D.: Introducing the Video In Situ Snowfall Sensor (VISSS), Atmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 899&ndash;919, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-899-2024, 2024.&nbsp;


The 2DVD data used in the study is given in the folder &ldquo;2DVD_data&rdquo;.


The windsond data are given in the folder &ldquo;Windsond&rdquo;.


The HATPRO data are given in the folder &ldquo;HATPRO&rdquo;.
