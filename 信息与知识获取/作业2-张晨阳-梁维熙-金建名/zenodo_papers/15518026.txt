Description:

This dataset contains manually verified aspect-based sentiment annotations for tourism-related Google Reviews in Central Java, Indonesia. It covers 10 popular tourist destinations and includes multilingual content (Indonesian and English). Each review is segmented and labeled based on the 3A tourism framework:<strong> Amenity, Attraction, and Accessibility</strong>, with sentiment polarities classified as <strong>Positive, Neutral, or Negative.</strong>


The annotation process combines rule-based aspect detection with LLM-enhanced verification. Specifically, this dataset was labeled using a hybrid approach that integrates a custom keyword dictionary and syntactic rules, refined through Gemini 2 (Google&rsquo;s LLM) for aspect and sentiment validation. This approach improves multilingual ABSA accuracy and consistency, especially in noisy user-generated content.
