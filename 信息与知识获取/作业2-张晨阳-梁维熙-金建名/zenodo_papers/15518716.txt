Description:

Health can be regarded as the real wealth of everyone. If we are in sound health, we can properly think about anything and do our best for the own development or the development of the society as a whole. It can play a vital role in the socio-economic development of a nation too. Access to quality healthcare remains a pressing concern in rural parts of India, particularly in the north-eastern region. This study investigates the multifaceted dimensions of healthcare access in Dergaon, a semi-rural area in Assam&rsquo;s Golaghat district. Employing a structured questionnaire, primary data were collected from 250 respondents covering demographic factors, frequency of healthcare utilization, barriers to access, and satisfaction levels. The findings reveal that socioeconomic status, transportation challenges, healthcare costs, and insurance coverage significantly affect access to medical services. The study also identifies critical gaps in preventive care and the presence of systemic barriers such as discrimination and language differences. Policy recommendations include expanding primary healthcare infrastructure, improving public health awareness, and ensuring equitable healthcare financing mechanisms.
