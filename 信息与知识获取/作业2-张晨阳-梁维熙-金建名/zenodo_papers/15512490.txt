Description:

This dataset includes a series of 3D models derived from the open-access digital replica of the Tomba dei Rilievi (Tomb of the Reliefs) at Cerveteri (Italy), designed and optimized for additive manufacturing using SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) technology.
The models have been redesigned and restructured to ensure printability, structural stability, and educational usability.
Each file is provided in STL format and accompanied by metadata regarding authorship, licensing, and modifications.
This work aims to support cultural heritage accessibility, physical prototyping, and responsible reuse of 3D data in research, education, and museology.


The original master model was created by Enzo d&rsquo;Annibale, Emanuel Demetrescu, and Daniele Ferdani.
The derived, printable versions were designed, optimized, and physically tested through SLS 3D printing by Eleonora Scopinaro.
