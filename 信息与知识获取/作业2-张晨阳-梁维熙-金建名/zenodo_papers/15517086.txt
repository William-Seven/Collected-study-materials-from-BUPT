<span>This study examines the thermal deformation behavior of a fiberglass composite polymer material, specifically a phenol-formaldehyde matrix, under various heating conditions. The material is subjected to uniform and one-sided heating at rates up to 600&deg;C/min, with a high-temperature gas flow reaching 2500&deg;C. The research focuses on the kinetics of thermal deformation, assessing how different heating rates and temperatures impact the composite material. The analysis involves computing the stressed-deformed state of reinforced plastic samples to measure their expansion under one-sided heating. Findings reveal that the coefficient of thermal deformation (&alpha;T\alpha_T&alpha;T) shows a linear dependence on temperature and stresses, which helps in preventing bending in free samples. Conversely, for bent samples, the absence of a stress gradient (&Delta;&sigma;=0\Delta\sigma = 0&Delta;&sigma;=0) at higher heating rates results in increased stress gradient values. Comparative data from dilatometry tests, conducted across a temperature range of 20 to 1100&deg;C, corroborate these observations, providing insights into the material's response to thermal and mechanical loads.</span>
