<h4>Abstract :</h4>

This study examines the influence of inclusive leadership on employees&rsquo; innovative work behavior, with job autonomy and psychological safety as mediating variables. In today&rsquo;s highly competitive and rapidly changing business environment, innovation is a critical factor for organizational success, especially in start-up companies dominated by millennials. Inclusive leadership, which emphasizes appreciation, employee involvement, and emotional support, has been shown to enhance job autonomy and create a psychologically safe work environment, encouraging employees to take risks and contribute fully to innovation. A multi-level approach analyzing interactions among individual, team, and psychological contexts is employed to understand these mechanisms. Focusing on start-up employees in Semarang, a rapidly growing hub with a strong millennial workforce, the study demonstrates that inclusive leadership plays a vital role in sustaining growth through fostering innovative behavior. The findings provide both theoretical and practical contributions for developing effective leadership strategies to support innovation in modern organizations.
