<em><span>This study determines the association of dietary practice, exercise pattern, and overweightness in children in both urban and rural Ganjam district, Odisha. For this, 500 youngsters, selected randomly from the urban area and 250 from the rural area, between the age group of 6 to 12 years were taken. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire to assess food habits, physical activity, and obesity status, with Body Mass Index calculated to determine the extent of obesity. The results show significant differences between the urban and rural youths. Obesity prevalence is higher for urban youths at 24.8 percent than that of their counterparts from the rural areas at 12.0 percent attributed to greater consumption of processed foods and a more sedentary lifestyle. Contrastingly, rural children have a higher level of physical activity and consume more processed foods less frequently. The results highlight the impact of urbanization, diet, and physical activity on obesity in children, and the programs should be implemented to promote healthy lifestyles, particularly in urban settings.</span></em>
