Description:

The vivid colors of fruits and vegetables arise from&nbsp;<strong>quantum interactions</strong>&nbsp;or effects in pigment molecules. Conjugated&nbsp;<strong>&pi;-electron</strong>&nbsp;systems in pigments like&nbsp;<strong>beta-carotene</strong>&nbsp;and chlorophyll absorb specific wavelengths of visible light via electronic transitions. Moreover, using the&nbsp;<strong>particle-in-a-box model</strong>, we can estimate these transitions and link them to observed colors. Hence, this results from unabsorbed, complementary wavelengths.
