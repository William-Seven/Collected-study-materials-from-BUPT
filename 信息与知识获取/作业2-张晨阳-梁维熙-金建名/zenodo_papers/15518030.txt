Description:

Bulletproof glass protects you by preventing bullets and objects from passing through. The fascinating process behind the strength and clarity of bulletproof glass becomes clear when you understand how it is made. Makers put together strong but see-through things. So, they build with fresh materials and methods, layering glass and plastic. Heat and pressure bond these layers together, ensuring the glass is both resilient and long-lasting. Thus, the combination of science and engineering guarantees that&nbsp;<strong>bulletproof glass</strong> performs effectively in challenging conditions.
