Description:

We derive a closed-form universal critical shear &epsilon; = 1/&radic;6 that marks the sharp transition between ray divergence and refocusing in a fully pre-metric model of null dynamics in (3+1) dimensions. This threshold emerges from a purely real-algebraic structure: a single cyclic quadratic constraint on ‚Ñù&sup3; that defines a two-sheeted null cone. We classify all vector fields that preserve this cone and show that, up to scaling and cyclic symmetry, a unique canonical flow governs its internal dynamics. Deforming this flow by a family of shear fields and projecting onto a quotient screen yields two solvable differential equations, from which the critical bifurcation arises. The threshold &epsilon; is independent of shear angle, base point, or coordinate frame, and survives embedding into three distinct completions: Minkowski space, a phase-space lightcone, and a lapse-tilted Ricci-flat spacetime. The same shear value reproduces a sign flip in the null Raychaudhuri equation, matches the curvature bifurcation of a PT-symmetric quantum Hamiltonian, and characterises a ùõæ-plane foliation of the Klein quadric. These correspondences suggest that &epsilon; arises intrinsically from the algebraic structure, not from any imposed geometry, and position the Hentsch model as a minimal analytic framework for pre-metric null dynamics with gravitational, optical, and quantum analogues.
