Description:

<span lang="EN-AU">This research examines teachers' practices, challenges, and coping mechanisms in applying the MATATAG Curriculum in the Iloilo Schools Division. The study employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine data from 403 teacher respondents, examining the way teaching practices, systemic obstacles, and coping actions affect curriculum delivery effectiveness. Results show that effective pedagogy, as described as learner-centered and creative methodologies, favorably impacts curriculum implementation. Nevertheless, teachers also experience significant challenges such as insufficient resources, voluminous workloads, and limited professional development opportunities that stand in the way of successful implementation of the MATATAG Curriculum. Despite all these constraints, teachers' adaptive systems like peer support, autonomous professional learning, and the incorporation of computer technology to some extent neutralize the adverse impacts of these obstacles. The research emphasizes the significance of ongoing professional learning, resource distribution, and teacher support systems in helping teachers cope with the intricacies of curriculum implementation. The findings indicate that the effective realization of the MATATAG Curriculum hinges not solely on the teaching practices of teachers but also on systemic support addressing challenges in teaching. The research demands an overall method of curriculum reform with a focus on empowering teachers and the necessity for strong support systems to enable the success of educational policies such as MATATAG. Implications for policy development, teacher education programs, and future curriculum reform research in the Philippine education setting arise from these findings.</span>
