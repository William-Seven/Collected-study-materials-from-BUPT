Authors: Roos Hoefgeest Toribio, Sara

Keywords: Synthetic defect generation, 3D surface inspection, Free-Form Deformation, Sensor simulation, CAD-based modeling, Industrial quality control

Description:

This dataset provides synthetic samples of surface defects generated on a CAD model of a car door. The defects include&nbsp;<strong>bumps and peaks</strong>, simulated using <strong>Free-Form Deformation (FFD)</strong> to ensure geometric realism and adaptability to curved surfaces. Surface acquisition is emulated using a <strong>virtual 3D profilometric sensor</strong>, incorporating both geometric and sensor noise to closely replicate real-world inspection conditions.


All samples are<strong> labeled</strong>, and the dataset includes <strong>depth images</strong>, trajectory data, and raw sensor outputs, making it suitable for training and evaluating surface defect detection models in industrial settings.&nbsp;


This dataset is associated with the&nbsp;<strong>TriPlay</strong> repository on GitHub:
