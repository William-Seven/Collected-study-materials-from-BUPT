Description:

<em><span lang="EN-GB">This article analyzes the linguocultural criteria of adequacy and equivalence in translation. In the translation process, equivalence ensures that the translated text aligns with the original text in lexical, grammatical, and semantic aspects, while adequacy is concerned with preserving the communicative and stylistic characteristics of the translation. The article also examines the influence of linguocultural factors on translation, the role of cultural realism, and the significance of a pragmatic approach. Differences between languages and cultures may present certain challenges for translators, making it essential to consider not only linguistic but also cultural nuances in translation.</span></em>
