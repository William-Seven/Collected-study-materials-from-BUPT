<strong>Abstract</strong>


Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with a high mortality, requiring personalised stratification strategies. Here, we characterise genetic variation that modulates MTOR, a critical regulator of metabolism and immune responses in sepsis. The effects are highly context specific, involving a regulatory element that affects MTOR expression in activated T cells with opposite direction of effect in neutrophils. We show that the G-allele of the lead variant, rs4845987, associated with decreased risk of T2D, reduces MTOR expression in T cells and improves survival in sepsis patients due to pneumonia, with effects specific to sepsis endotype. Using ex vivo models, we demonstrate that activated T cells promote immunosuppressive sepsis neutrophils through released cytokines, a process dampened by hypoxia and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Our work demonstrates a novel epigenetic mechanism that fine-tunes MTOR transcription and T cell activity via the variant-containing regulatory element, which exhibits an allelic effect upon vitamin C treatment. These findings reveal how genetic variation interacts with disease state to modulate immune cell-cell communication, providing a patient stratification strategy to inform more effective sepsis treatment.
