Description:

<em><span>This paper investigates the ethics of Rahab, the Canaanite in Joshua 2:1-7, through which this Gentile Canaanite woman made a significant contribution to the Bible and its implications for contemporary discussion about faith, justice, and morality. Exegetically, the paper draws on Rahab's act of receiving Israelite explorers as a starting point from which to recognize the quandary ביננוּ (between us)&mdash;the often two-sided nature of living in oppressive and unjust contexts. How do her actions affect one's sense of truthfulness, and what does a higher moral imperative suggest about ethical loyalty? Her place in the genealogy of Jesus, alongside many other unexpected women, and her affirmation in the New Testament as "a great example of faith" demonstrate redemption and forgiveness that challenge notions about criminality or stigma where a person is judged for their former life. This paper focuses on Rahab and, through the study of her story, seeks to expand and deepen the relevance of her story in contemporary ethical discussions&ndash;within these, the role that faith plays in ethical consideration will be illuminated for both its pertinence and value-added in ethical reflection.</span></em><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>
