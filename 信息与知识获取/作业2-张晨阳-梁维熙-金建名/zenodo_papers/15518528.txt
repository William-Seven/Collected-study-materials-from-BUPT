Description:

<span lang="EN-AU">Efforts to understand perceptions of violence in intimate relationships (VIR) and associated factors could be important as they impact future aggressive behaviours. Aim of this study was to find out how childhood experiences of violence, attitudes toward VIR, and prior VIR experiences affect perceptions of VIR, considering gender as a moderator. <span>Method: </span>To investigate this, a quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted as an online questionnaire. The sample included 410 adult subjects in intimate relationships or singles who were in an intimate relationship in the past year. <span>Results: </span>It could be shown that women perceive psychological, physical and sexualized VIR more strongly than men. In addition, gender was partially found to moderate the relationship between attitudes towards VIR as well as previous VIR experiences as well as abuse in childhood and perceptions of VIR. <span>Conclusions: </span>Among others, the results can be explained by gender schemes and social norms. Furthermore, recommendations for intervention and prevention programs can be derived from the findings. It is possible that both genders could benefit from addressing their VIR and abuse experiences and their attitudes.</span>
