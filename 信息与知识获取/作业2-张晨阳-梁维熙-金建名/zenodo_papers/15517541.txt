Description:

The AMBA AHB protocol is an on-chip communication standard that defines the rules for transferring data between master and slave devices. It's widely used in System -On -Chip (SoC) designs and microcontrollers. A M B A includes different bus architectures, such as Advanced System Bus (ASB), Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB), and Advanced HighPerformance Bus (AHB ). A H B stands out as the highperformance and high-bandwidth option, making it the preferred choice for systems with high-frequency clocks.
