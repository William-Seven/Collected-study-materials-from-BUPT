Description:

<span lang="EN-US">The paper reviews the most important approaches to entrepreneurship, with a significant focus on new business models emerging as a result of business sustainability. Thus, entrepreneurs who operate in the context of a dynamic, turbulent environment, with multiple transformations in their activity as a result of business sustainability and digitalization, are forced to capitalize on business opportunities through the lens of adjusting business models to the new context. Thus, sustainability and digital transformation have imposed the emergence of new business models such as: the marketplace model, drop-shipping, peer-to-peer, which have radically transformed the business environment, generating new opportunities for the entire society. The research methods used are: analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, abduction, documentation. Finally, we can highlight that every entrepreneur must rethink their own business model in order to remodel the business by capitalizing on the multiple opportunities generated by digitalization and sustainability, which are ready to offer a new life to the business, and a new path to increasing organizational performance. </span>
