Description:

This study investigates how eating habits influence childhood obesity in the rural and
urban Ganjam districts of Odisha. A total of 500 children were studied, with 250 from urban
and 250 from rural areas, focusing on socioeconomic characteristics, food consumption
patterns, nutritional intake, and BMI classifications. According to the results, there are
significant differences in the prevalence of overweight and obesity between children in urban
and rural areas. Children in urban areas are more likely to be obese and to have bad eating
behaviors, such as consuming sugary drinks and fast food often. Children in rural areas, on
the other hand, were shown to maintain healthier weight statuses due to their more active
lives and easier access to traditional, nutrient-dense meals. Furthermore, it was evidenced
that the prevalence of obesity, particularly in metropolitan cities, was affected by social
characteristics, such as family income and parental education. In attempting to reduce
juvenile obesity, in both urban and rural areas, the results reveal a need for targeted
interventions to improve eating habits and physical activity and be conscious of social
factors.&nbsp;
