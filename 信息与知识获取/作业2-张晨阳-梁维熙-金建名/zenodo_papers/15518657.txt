Description:

<span lang="EN-PH">This study investigates the perceived severity of environmental degradation among coastal communities on Higatangan Island, Philippines. Coastal ecosystems face mounting pressures from human activity and climate change, making community perception vital for effective local environmental management. Using a descriptive quantitative approach, the study surveyed adult household members across two barangays to assess their views on four key environmental issues: coastal water pollution, coral reef degradation, deforestation, and air pollution.<strong> </strong>Findings reveal that coastal water pollution (49.52%) and coral reef degradation (40%) are perceived as the most severe threats, while deforestation (0%) and air pollution (1.9%) are viewed with minimal concern. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in perception between the two barangays, indicating a shared environmental awareness shaped by common geographic and socio-economic contexts.<strong> </strong>These insights underscore the importance of integrating local perceptions into environmental policies and educational initiatives. Prioritizing marine conservation efforts while expanding awareness of less visible issues can enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of community-based resource management on the island.</span>
