Description:

In recent years, the circular economy has evolved from a waste management concept to a systemic approach addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution by extending material lifespans and maintaining quality. However, dominant narratives in academia, politics, and institutions emphasize techno-economic solutions focused on supply chain efficiency and economic growth, often sidelining democratic engagement and social justice considerations. Recognizing these gaps, this report aims to broaden the circular economy narrative by integrating it with just transition principles through mapping definitions, conceptualizing a just circular economy, examining social impacts across key value chains (batteries, textiles, plastics), and assessing current policies to recommend steps toward a more socially equitable transition.
