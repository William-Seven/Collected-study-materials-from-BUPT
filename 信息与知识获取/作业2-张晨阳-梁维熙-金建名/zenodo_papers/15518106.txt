Description:

M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France has been involved in real-time seasonal forecasting activities since the late 1990s, and
in operational production of seasonal forecasts for the Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S)
since 2017. This document provides the technical description of the 9th version of its seasonal
forecasting system, planned to come into operations in April 2025. System 9 is an updated version
building on the two preceding systems 7 and 8, respectively released in 2019 and 2021, and
documented in Batt&eacute; et al. (2019) and Batt&eacute; et al. (2021).
Section 2 of this report provides a brief overview of the new system, while Section 3 describes in
detail each model component, including the main novelty which is the NEMO 4.2 ocean model coming
along the SI3 sea-ice model. Section 4 is dedicated to the initialization strategy, for which a similar
initialization strategy as in System 7 is used. Section 5 is dedicated to the ensemble generation
strategy, which is similar to System 8. Section 6 provides an overview of the workflow procedures,
from initialization to post-processing.
