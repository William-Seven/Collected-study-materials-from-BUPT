Description:

This dataset collection contains Google Reviews from ten tourist destinations located in Central Java, Indonesia, each manually annotated using a rule-based aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) approach. The destinations include both cultural and recreational sites such as temples, mosques, beaches, historical landmarks, and family attractions.


Each review has been labeled based on three primary tourism aspects:

<ul>
<li>Amenities</li>
<li>Attractions</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

In addition to the aspect category, each label is also assigned a sentiment polarity: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. This structured sentiment labeling enables detailed analysis of tourist perceptions and supports downstream tasks such as tourism recommender systems, public service evaluation, and sentiment-aware destination ranking.
