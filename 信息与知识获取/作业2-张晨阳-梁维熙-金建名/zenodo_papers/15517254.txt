Description:

The hospitality industry, particularly star-category hotels, functions in an ever-changing setting where diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are becoming central to organizational effectiveness for both employees and as well as for guests. Implementing DEI focused recruitment strategies comes with ethical responsibility, but is also necessary for the business. This article evaluates the recruitment strategies of star category hotels with regard to their ability to preserve and retain a diverse workforce in the hotels. The article identifies major issues within the organization, such as ignorance, lack of organized talent pools, and inconsistent application of recruitment drives that are supposed to be standardized in terms of diversity. Moreover, it assesses the rational consequences of diversity, in adding to team performance, visitor satisfaction, and innovation to the hotel organization.
The article reveals that hotels with effective DEI frameworks experience higher staff engagement, increased problem-solving ability, and enhanced adaptability during their operational hours. This highlights AI-assisted bias reduction tools, partnerships with underrepresented groups, and regular DEI audits with help of government as ways of promoting holistic DEI strategies. This study emphasizes purposeful recruitment strategies aimed at operational efficiency while also building diverse and robust teams to achieve sustained organizational success in hospitality industry. The study seeks to provide a thorough manual for participants to grasp and use DEI-driven recruiting policies, thereby helping to create a more fair and efficient hotel industry in future.
