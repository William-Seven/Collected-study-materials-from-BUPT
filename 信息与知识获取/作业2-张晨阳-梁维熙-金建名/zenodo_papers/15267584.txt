Title: Conductance-based Model for Internal Partial Discharges

Authors: Linde, Thomas

Keywords: 

Publication date: 2025

Description:

This is supplementary material for the publication Numerical Modeling of Internal Partial Discharges under Distorted
Voltages: Study on Frequency Dependency by Thomas Linde and Maria Kosse of TUD Dresden University of Technology.


At the date of creation of this repository, the publication was submitted for the IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena 2025 in Manchester, UK.&nbsp;


The model in this repository is a conductance-based partial discharge model. It is used to calculate partial discharges inside a void within a solid insulation material as a time-dependent simulation. The model uses MATLAB 2023b and COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2.&nbsp;


This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - project&nbsp;number&nbsp; 505291711.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>looper.m is a MATLAB function that builds the outer frame of the calculations. Voltage, frequency and parameters can be set and adjusted. The results from the single calculations are exported.</li>
<li>runSimulation.m gives a set of function that use the COMSOL LiveLink interface to set parameters, extract results from COMSOL and controls the time-dependent electrical current (ec) simulations in COMSOL.</li>
<li>NamedConst.m is a class file that stores permanent constants used in the functions of runSimulation.m</li>
<li>COMSOL_model_void.mph is a COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 file that contains the geometry, parameter framework, meshing, study settings incl. stop conditions and probes (for measuring / probing certain parameters inside the model).</li>
