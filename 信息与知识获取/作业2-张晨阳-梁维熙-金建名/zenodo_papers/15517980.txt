Description:

This dataset contains several additional figures and data for the "Nine Martian Years of polar caps observations by SPICAM-IR/Mars-Express". Data and additional figures play special role in this publication, since we use a lot of different representations (seasonal, spatial and cap edges) of sparse dataset in our work. It also includes processed SPICAM-IR CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;ice equivalent width and water index for orbits without artifacts or distortions and with normal signal-to-noise ratio (&gt;20).
&nbsp;


<strong>Data Set S1&nbsp;</strong>
This Data Set (spicam_obs.csv) contains CO<sub>2</sub> ice equivalent width and water index for orbits without artifacts or distortions and with normal signal-to-noise ratio (&gt;20) and all required observational geometry in a form of csv table. In this file there are 12 following columns:

<ul>
<li>

orbit: name of orbit as in PSA 1B files

</li>
<li>

spec_num: number of spectrum in this file starting from zero

</li>
<li>

lat: center latitude of field of view

</li>
<li>

lon: center longitude of field of view

</li>
<li>

ls: solar longitude of observation

</li>
<li>

local_time: local time of observation

</li>
<li>

incidence: incidence angle

</li>
<li>

alt_spc: altitude of observation, which determines FOV size

</li>
<li>

co2ice_index: equivalent width of CO ice 1.43 &mu;m band

</li>
<li>

h2oice_index: index of 1.5 &mu;m water ice band

</li>
<li>

snr: signal-to-noise ratio measure around 1.37 &mu;m, out of major absorption bands

</li>
<li>

martian_year: Martian Year

</li>
</ul>

Using this dataset one can plot all of the figures in the original paper, except for spectra.
