Title: Stable Roommates Experimentation Toolkit

Authors: Glitzner, Frederik

Publication date: 2025-05-26

Description:

This software can be used to compute various structures of Stable Roommates instances, e.g., to compute a reduced stable partition, a stable matching (if one exists), an almost stable matching, or to enumerate all stable partitions or all stable matchings. The code also provides a random generator relying on the mapel-roommates package and scripts to distribute the computation across a compute cluster. A paper describing experimental results derived using this software package can be found here:
