Description:

The study had to assess the IPC practices among students attending medical college
in India. A sample of 103 medical college students from the 3rd and 4th years participated in
the survey. According to the results, 87.3% students know about infection, and 56% of this
information had been obtained from college. However, 76.7% had knowledge about infection
prevention with a gap in their understanding. Infection control practice knowledge was at a
very high level at 85.3%. All the students realized that hand hygiene is crucial and that there
is total acceptance of wearing gowns when doing surgical procedures. With PPE, 54.7%
were familiar, and almost half did not know, but there was an awareness that patients are
also potential sources of infection (88.7%). A total of 88.7% of students reported using gloves
during patient contact when exposed to blood or infectious secretions. Still, only 46.7% of the
students claimed to have ever witnessed transmission-based precautions applied in the care
of a patient. The researchers found that though medical students understand many of the IPC
principles well, certain aspects must be highlighted during training and curricula
development.
