Description:

<em><span>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of philosophical frameworks on assessment practices in higher education, specifically at the Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka. The research aims to identify the philosophical frameworks predominantly used by faculty members and examine their influence on assessment practices. Guided by four research questions, the study seeks to provide insights that can inform the development of more effective and cohesive assessment strategies. Employing a survey research design, the study targeted a population of approximately 250 lecturers; with a sample size of 150 participants selected through a combination of convenience and stratified random sampling. A structured questionnaire consisting of 27 items was used for data collection, ensuring validity through expert consultation and reliability established at a coefficient of 0.88. Data were gathered via online and in-person methods, with 136 completed questionnaires analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's Rank Order Correlation, and F-test. The major findings indicated that constructivist frameworks are predominantly utilized among faculty members, significantly influencing their assessment practices. The study concluded that philosophical beliefs play a crucial role in shaping effective assessment methods and recommended the implementation of professional development programs focusing on educational philosophies. Additionally, fostering collaboration among faculty and establishing mechanisms for student feedback were identified as essential steps to enhance assessment practices and overall educational quality.</span></em>
