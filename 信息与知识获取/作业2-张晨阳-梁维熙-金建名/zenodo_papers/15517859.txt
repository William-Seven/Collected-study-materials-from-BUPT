<em><span>This cross-sectional study explores the dietary habits and nutritional status of breastfeeding mothers in Ganjam District, Odisha. The study focuses specifically on how these factors influence hormonal balance and lactation results so as to better understand how these factors influence lactation outcomes. The survey, which was carried out with 115 moms, showed that the majority of the mothers were younger, ranging in age from twenty to thirty years old, and that a high concentration of respondents was in the three-to-four-month breastfeeding phase. The research reveals that a significant number of moms in the area adhere to conventional diets that are high in carbohydrates. As a result, they frequently do not consume sufficient amounts of critical nutrients such as iron, calcium, and protein, which can have a detrimental effect on their hormonal health. These nutritional imbalances can result in hormonal deficits, which can have an impact on milk production, maternal energy levels, and general health. This may be one of the factors that contributes to the decrease in breastfeeding length after four months. This study highlights the need for culturally tailored nutritional treatments and public health initiatives that address these inadequacies and promote prolonged breastfeeding habits. This is because proper nutrition during lactation is intimately linked to both the health of the mother and the growth of the infant.</span></em>
