Description:

This article investigates the transformative influence of tourism on the local business ecosystem in Uzbekistan, with a particular focus on the Samarkand region&mdash;a major cultural and historical hub. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that combines statistical analysis with field interviews and observations, the study examines how increasing tourist inflows have reshaped the structure, composition, and performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Findings reveal that tourism acts as a critical catalyst for business diversification, entrepreneurial innovation, and employment generation, especially in sectors such as hospitality, handicrafts, food services, and transportation. However, the benefits remain unevenly distributed, with infrastructure challenges, financial constraints, and seasonal fluctuations limiting broader inclusion. The article highlights the need for adaptive policy frameworks that integrate local businesses into tourism value chains and support sustainable growth. By analyzing the Samarkand region as a microcosm, the study provides insights into how tourism can serve as a strategic engine for regional development in Uzbekistan.
