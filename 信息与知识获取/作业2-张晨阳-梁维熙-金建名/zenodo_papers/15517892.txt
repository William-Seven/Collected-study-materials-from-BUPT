Description:

George Kaufmann (1894-1963) was the remarkably talented linguist who extemporaneously&nbsp;translated lectures of Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) from German to English for Anglo audiences.&nbsp;Later, he was the translator of Steiner's Koberwitz &lsquo;Agriculture Course&rsquo; (1929). His colleague, Olive&nbsp;Whicher (1910-2006), has written a biography &lsquo;George Adams: Interpreter of Rudolf Steiner&rsquo; (1977).&nbsp;From September 1940, he was &lsquo;George Adams&rsquo;, adopting his mother&rsquo;s maiden name. During WW2 a&nbsp;Germanic name was a burden and all three Kaufmann siblings adopted new names (Adams, Elgin&nbsp;and Mann). But for Rudolf Steiner he was always George Kaufmann. This presentation considers his&nbsp;life in the formative Kaufmann years (before Olive Whicher&rsquo;s association). George&rsquo;s father was&nbsp;Australian born mining engineer (George von Kaufmann) and his mother British (Kate Adams). The&nbsp;couple moved to Eastern Europe and George was born shortly after. He attended Mill Hill boarding&nbsp;school in London, travelling home to Solotwina and Poland during school holidays. George studied&nbsp;Mathematics and Chemistry at Christ&rsquo;s College, University of Cambridge (1912-1915) and was&nbsp;awarded an MA. During WW1, George applied as a conscientious objector but recognition was&nbsp;refused. He was arrested, court-martialled, and served time variously in Wormwood Scrubs Prison&nbsp;and Wandsworth Prison. George joined the Anthroposophy movement of Rudolf Steiner in 1916 in&nbsp;Britain. After the war met Steiner at the Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland (in 1919). He married&nbsp;Mary Fox in Berlin in 1920 and he reported on post war conditions in Poland for Quaker Relief. As a&nbsp;translator of Rudolf Steiner George Kaufmann was without peer. He first translated for the English&nbsp;Teachers Course at the Goetheanum in 1919, and subsequently at Steiner&rsquo;s Summer Schools&nbsp;including at Penmaenmawr (1923) and Torquay (1924). George devoted his life to Steiner and&nbsp;Anthroposophy, and he was the leading British Anthroposophist of his generation. The prospect of the&nbsp;George Adams Research Centre at Sunhill, Clent sponsored by Ruskin Mill Trust is a worthy and&nbsp;welcome development.
