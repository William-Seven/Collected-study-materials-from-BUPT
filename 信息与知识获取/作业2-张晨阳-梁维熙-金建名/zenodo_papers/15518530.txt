Description:

This repository contains the R scripts used in the study "Global biome changes over the last 21,000 years inferred from model&ndash;data comparisons" (Li et al., 2024, Clim. Past, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1862). The scripts were developed to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of global biome shifts based on a harmonized dataset of pollen-based biome reconstructions and Earth system model outputs.
