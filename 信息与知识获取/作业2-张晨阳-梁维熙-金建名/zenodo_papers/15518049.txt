Description:

Four different designs for 3D printing of breast tumor perfusion phantoms. Including:

<ol>
<li>A gyroid phantom with two different pore sized sizes (1.3 and 1.5 mm diameter)</li>
<li>A small channel phantom with four 0.8 mm diameter channels and four 1 mm diameter channels</li>
<li>A leaking vessel phantom with eight small channels and a leaking outer shell. One of the designs has two different diameter channels (0.8 and 1 mm).</li>
<li>A gyroid dual input and output phantom. The phantom has a dividing wall between the two sides and two inputs and outputs to create different flow patterns inside the phantom</li>
</ol>
