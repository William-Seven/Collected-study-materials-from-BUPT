Description:

<span lang="EN-US">This paper addresses a new paradigm of sustainability in business, green human resource management, which emerged as a result of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, which produced major changes in human resource management in the business environment. Thus, as a result of the adoption of the 17 sustainable development goals, companies have aligned their human resource management activities with the approach to achieving sustainability, which involves significant changes in the conduct of human resource management activities, as well as the integration of sustainability approaches into all company activities. As a result, human resource management has integrated ecological practices, ethical principles and social responsibility, in order to create a balance between economic development and ecological and social responsibility. The research methods used are: analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, abduction, documentation, etc., which helped us to obtain the expected results. Finally, we can highlight the fact that every company operating in the current context is obliged to remodel its human resource management activities in order to integrate sustainable practices into every human resource management activity in order to achieve competitiveness and sustainability in business. </span>
