Description:

<em><span lang="EN-US">Tourism is not only associated with economics, politics, development, and investment, but the most visited areas also reveal insights that are highly relevant to regional planning. Hence, this article investigates the intersection between sustainable tourism development and shifting urban planning paradigms in Uzbekistan&rsquo;s three most visited cities: Samarkand, Bukhara, and Tashkent. Due to their geographical locations and rich histories, these cities embody distinct urban forms shaped by pre-modern organic growth, Soviet-era central planning, and post-independence neoliberal reforms. By integrating sustainability perspectives, this study analyzes how these layered planning histories influence the tourism dynamics of Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara. Drawing on statistical tourism data, planning documents, online visuals of the cities&rsquo; landscapes, and urban development literature, a comparative analysis between these three cities forms the core methodological approach. The research indicates that sustainable tourism in historic cities goes beyond merely preserving heritage or expanding infrastructure; it necessitates a tailored urban planning strategy that cohesively blends spatial design, cultural identity, and visitor experience as interconnected elements.</span></em>
