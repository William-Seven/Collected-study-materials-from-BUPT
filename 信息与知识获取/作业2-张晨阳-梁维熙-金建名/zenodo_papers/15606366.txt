Description:

<strong><span>Abstract</span></strong><span>&mdash;</span><strong>Humans perceive the world through vision, and image processing strives to empower machines with similar capabilities. OpenCV, a robust library of programming functions, acts as the brain behind computer vision tasks, enabling machines to interpret and analyze visual data. Despite its widespread adoption, OpenCV faces challenges in handling large datasets effectively, limiting its scalability for modern applications. This paper delves into these challenges and introduces a novel approach to optimize OpenCV for large dataset processing, thereby addressing its current limitations.</strong>
