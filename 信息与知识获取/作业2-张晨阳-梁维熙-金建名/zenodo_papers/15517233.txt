Description:

<em><span lang="EN-US">This study investigates the impact of specialized training methods on the development of speed-strength qualities in freestyle wrestling aged 14 to 16. A total of 24 athletes were divided into 2 groups: an experimental group that followed an 8-week target program focusing on explosive strength, and a control group that continued traditional wrestling training. Physical performance was assessed using standard motor test, including the standing long jump, vertical jump, and 10-meter sprint, before and after the intervention. The result showed statistically significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control group (p &lt;0.05), indicating the effectiveness of the applied methods in enhancing speed-strength indicators. These findings support the integration of innovative training approaches to improve the physical preparedness of adolescent freestyle wrestlers. </span></em>
