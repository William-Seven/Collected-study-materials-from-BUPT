Description:

Geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis are the modern
platform (method) for intelligent data interpretation. The study presents the results of
geospatial data analysis of the land suitability of Heavy Chernozems (Karasolutsi) from
Dobrich region - North-Eastern Bulgaria. The results are visualized in the form of thematic
maps by suitability for growing main agricultural crops, land category, and land classification
according to FAO. The investigated soils are the most suitable for growing wheat and corn
(from the cereal crops), sunflower (from the technical crops), alfalfa (from the fodder crops)
and cherries (from the fruit crops). They mainly refer to the 3rd and 4th categories or "good
lands", and according to the FAO classification - class S1 suitable lands and class S2
moderately suitable lands.
