Description:

Outsourcing has evolved significantly from being merely a strategy to reduce costs or delegate non-core functions. Today, organizations increasingly collaborate with outsourcing service providers not just for cost efficiency, but also to access specialized skills, enhance service quality, and improve adaptability to dynamic business demands (Linder et al., 2002).
One of the most prominent sectors benefiting from this global outsourcing trend is Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)&mdash;a rapidly growing industry in the Philippines. More than a profitable endeavor, BPO has become the country&rsquo;s fastest-expanding industry, generating substantial employment and economic activity across the nation, including areas beyond Metro Manila (Natividad, 2015). In fact, the administrative and support service sector, including BPO, has recorded the highest accession rate at 19.97%, indicating that for every 1,000 employees, 200 new workers are hired either through expansion or replacement (Recide, 2015).
Despite these positive economic indicators, a frequently overlooked yet critical concern is the psychological, emotional, and physical well-being of BPO employees. Most BPO operations function during graveyard shifts to align with international client time zones, often resulting in chronic stress and fatigue among workers. Reports and observations indicate that many BPO employees experience high levels of stress after work, which, if unaddressed, could negatively impact both personal health and organizational productivity.
To counter this, organizations must actively cultivate a positive work environment where job satisfaction and motivation are prioritized. As Rigsbee (2001) aptly stated, &ldquo;A happy worker is a productive worker.&rdquo; Job satisfaction reflects the attitudes and feelings individuals have about their work. Positive and favorable attitudes indicate high job satisfaction, while negative feelings denote dissatisfaction. The quality of work life, recognition, compensation, and interpersonal relationships all contribute to how satisfied an employee feels in their role (Armstrong, 2003).
In addition to satisfaction, employee motivation plays a pivotal role in influencing performance and productivity. Even when employees possess the right skills, a conducive environment, and clear job expectations, without adequate motivation, their performance may falter. Managers, therefore, must understand and align with employees&rsquo; needs, values, goals, and drives to foster genuine motivation (Dell, 2003).
