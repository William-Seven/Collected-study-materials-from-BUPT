<strong><span lang="TR">Background</span></strong><span lang="TR">: University students are particularly vulnerable to smartphone addiction, according to recent studies, since they spend a lot of time using their devices, which exacerbates the negative impacts of excessive use. <strong>Objective</strong>: The study identifies levels of smartphone addiction and academic Achievement and finds the relationship between them. <strong>Methods</strong>: A descriptive study used a questionnaire based on demographical data, the Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version, and an academic Achievement scale from 2024 until 2025. A purposive sample was 1700 students collected from five universities in Mosul City, Iraq. The targeted study is students in different colleges from the third and fourth year, divided between scientific and humanities colleges. The data was collected from November 2024 and continued until January 2025. <strong>Results</strong>: Data represented that 42.6% of participants have a severe addiction to smartphones, which leads to a decrease in academic Achievement, which is significant at p-value = 0.000. <strong>Conclusions</strong>: smartphone addiction does not serve as a strong predictor for their academic Achievement. <strong>Recommendations</strong>: activate awareness programs continuously. These programs aimed to encourage students about time management, the benefits and risks of smartphones, and the effects on health, daily activity, passion, psychology cases, and their future lives.</span>
