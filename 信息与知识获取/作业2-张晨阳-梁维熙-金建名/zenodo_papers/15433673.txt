Description:

<span lang="EN-GB">This survey-based analysis shows how EU-level regulations - such as REACH, CLP and the Food Enzymes Directives - are implemented at national level by the consortium's member states. It also sheds light on country-specific requirements such as national safety assessments or independent regulatory pathways in countries such as the UK and Turkey. These results should inform all OXIPRO partners about the potential regulatory opportunities and bottlenecks that may affect the use of enzymes.</span>


<span lang="EN-GB">Understanding the legal framework in Europe and the associated partner countries is crucial for the successful development and introduction of enzyme-based innovations within the framework of OXIPRO. This overview was prepared as part of Work Package 1 (WP1), Task 1.1: Stakeholder Identification and Engagement (Lead: SBSM; Contributors: REDINN, NORCE, LEITAT, all partners; M01-M48), and serves as a basis for supporting the overall project objectives. A key objective of OXIPRO is to engage stakeholders from the four strategic areas - research, business, policy and society - to maximise the impact and market readiness of the project results. Regulatory stakeholders, including national and European administrations, policy makers and security authorities, are at the centre of these efforts. Effectively identifying and engaging these stakeholders is critical not only for the diffusion and adoption of OXIPRO technologies, but also for overcoming the regulatory barriers that can hinder innovation.</span>
