Description:

Urban traffic congestion is a growing problem, particularly during peak hours. Traditional static road dividers cannot accommodate dynamic traffic flow, leading to inefficiencies. This project proposes an IoT-based Movable Road Divider that shifts lanes dynamically based on real-time traffic conditions detected through ultrasonic and IR sensors. Using a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, the system controls servo motors to adjust divider positions and uploads traffic data to ThingSpeak for monitoring. The system offers a scalable and intelligent solution for modern traffic management.
