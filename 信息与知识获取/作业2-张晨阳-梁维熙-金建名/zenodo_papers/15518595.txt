Description:

This study explores the role of English in Uzbekistan as a tool of cultural diplomacy during the post-Soviet
period. Following independence, Uzbekistan adopted English as a strategic resource to shape its image on the international
stage and to foster global integration. Using a qualitative research approach, the study analyzed documents from the
Ministry of Education of Uzbekistan, reports from international organizations, and content from media and social networks.
The findings reveal that English serves as a significant bridge in Uzbekistan&rsquo;s educational system, international cooperation,
and cultural engagement, contributing to the enhancement of the country&rsquo;s global image. However, the growing
presence of English also calls for a careful balance between promoting national identity and preserving local languages.
The results of this study offer practical guidance for developing Uzbekistan&rsquo;s language policy and cultural diplomacy strategies.
Moreover, they provide a basis for comparative analysis for other post-Soviet states. The study underscores the
strategic importance of English in strengthening Uzbekistan&rsquo;s global position and presents recommendations for future
policy reforms.
