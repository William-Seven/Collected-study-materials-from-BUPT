Description:

<span>Various strategies are being deployed to address finance for housing development in Nigeria. However, few localised studies have examined factors hindering the performance of cooperative societies to assist with housing development. The article aims to investigate the barriers that hinder cooperative societies' involved in housing delivery in Osogbo and Olorunda local government areas of Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria. The study used a quantitative research design, with a questionnaire survey. Using the multi-stage sampling technique, 110 cooperative societies were selected across the local government areas and the structured questionnaire was administered to one member in each selected cooperative society. Data collected was analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency table) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results of the communality values based on PCA showed that financial and land regulation, loan management, and credibility of co-operators are the factors affecting the ability of cooperative societies in funding housing development in Osogbo. The study concluded that cooperative societies have a significant impact on housing delivery in Osogbo. Based on these findings, it is clear that, if cooperative societies are well supported by government policies such as public-private collaborations on land acquisitions, urban housing production challenges could be reduced.</span>
