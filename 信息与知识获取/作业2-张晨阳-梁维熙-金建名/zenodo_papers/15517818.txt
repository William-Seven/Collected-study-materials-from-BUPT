Description:

<em><span>This study aims to examine the dyslipidemia profiles and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors of type 2 diabetic patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Eastern Odisha, categorized into urban and rural populations. Two hundred type 2 diabetics from rural areas and two hundred from urban areas made up the sample for this quantitative cross-sectional study. Biochemical parameters such as fasting blood sugar (FBS), postprandial blood sugar (PPBS), hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and VLDL were evaluated alongside sociodemographic data and cardiovascular disease risk factors such obesity, hypertension, and lack of physical exercise. Findings revealed that urban patients had much worse glycemic and lipid management than their rural counterparts, as seen by significantly higher levels of FBS, PPBS, HbA1c, LDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. HDL and VLDL levels, on the other hand, were greater among rural people. Additionally, there was a greater prevalence of CVD risk factors, such as physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, among urban populations. According to these data, there are notable differences in the management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk between urban and rural areas, indicating the necessity of individualized healthcare plans for each group.</span></em>
