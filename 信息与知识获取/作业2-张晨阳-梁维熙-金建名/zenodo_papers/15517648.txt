Description:

This cross-sectional study examines the connection between treatment approaches,
dietary habits, and underlying causes of hormone imbalances in young girls in Brahmapur
City, Ganjam District, Odisha. The purpose of the study is to investigate how disorders
including irregular periods and hair growth are affected by dietary choices, medical
interventions, and psychological and lifestyle factors. The study included 150 female
participants, ages 18 to 30, who had been diagnosed with hormonal abnormalities.
Structured questionnaires covering food eating patterns, therapies taken, and perceived
causal factors such as workload and depression were used to gather data. According to the
findings, eating junk and spicy food was substantially linked to hormonal issues, especially
irregular periods. Furthermore, when therapies were given, their efficacy varied, and a
sizable percentage of participants did not receive any treatment. Hormonal disruptions were
also significantly exacerbated by lifestyle factors, such as workload, and psychological
issues, such as depression. These results point to the necessity of public health initiatives to
treat hormone imbalances in young girls by emphasizing stress management, mental
wellness, and balanced meals.
