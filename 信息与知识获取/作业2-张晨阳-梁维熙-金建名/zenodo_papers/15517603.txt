<strong><em><span>Abstract</span></em></strong>


<em><span>This research departed from producer&rsquo;s behavior in promoting their product through Islamic sharia approach using halal certification or religious media to make the people interested in consuming them. Such condition encouraged the author to study more deeply the halal certificate as an ideology. In this research, data collection was carried out through observation, interview, and document. Field observation on the application of halal to product and media applied in restaurants. Direct interview was carried out with the policy makers of Indonesian Ulema Councils; producers representing corporations and Micro-, small-, and medium-scale enterprises; consumers, and media and branding experts related to halal label. Data constitutes data relating to halal label media and its promotion media. The data was validated using triangulation process and analyzed using ideological approach. The finding of research shows that there are four types of ideology relating to halal certification: capitalism obliging products to have halal certificate; socialism applying halal certification as prestige; authoritarianism generating pros and cons on halal label; and democracy performed by the people to deal with the implementation of halal product.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></em>
