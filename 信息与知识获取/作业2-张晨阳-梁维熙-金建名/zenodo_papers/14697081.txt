A principal components (PCs) dataset (640&ndash;850 nm) generated using a principal component analysis approach to reconstruct the shape of the reflectance spectrum for the leaf and canopy levels. For the leaf level, a novel SIF-free leaf spectra dataset (n = 849, species = 95) collected at three sites in Beijing, China during June and August 2023, was used. For the canopy level, a total of 305,640 SIF-free spectra generated using a SCOPE model based on the measured leaf reflectance and transmittance was employed.
