Publication date: 2025-05-26

Description:

**teMatDb** is a digitized thermoelectric material database constructed from literature-reported thermoelectric property curves. This release (v1.1.6) serves as the foundational dataset (*teMatDb272*) used in the teMatDb-based paper currently in preparation.


The dataset includes:


- 355 raw digitized thermoelectric property (TEP) curve sets &nbsp;
- 272 high-fidelity samples curated using a self-consistent ZT filtering protocol &nbsp;
- Temperature-dependent curves for: &nbsp;
&nbsp; - Seebeck coefficient, &alpha;(T) &nbsp;
&nbsp; - Electrical resistivity, &rho;(T) &nbsp;
&nbsp; - Thermal conductivity, &kappa;(T) &nbsp;
&nbsp; - Figure of merit, ZT(T)


This database supports reproducible thermoelectric analysis and data-driven materials research.
